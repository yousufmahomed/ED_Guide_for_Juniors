        <h2 class="subheading">Child's Medical History</h2>
        <p>Start by asking the child's caregiver about their symptoms and medical history, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ear discomfort or pain: Children may experience ear pain due to infections, fluid buildup, or other issues.</li>
            <li>Hearing concerns: Inquire about any difficulties the child has with hearing or responding to sounds.</li>
            <li>Balance and dizziness issues: Ask about any episodes of unsteadiness or vertigo the child has experienced.</li>
            <li>Speech and communication: Assess the child's language development and any speech-related concerns.</li>
            <li>Nasal congestion or breathing problems: Inquire about any breathing difficulties, snoring, or persistent congestion.</li>
            <li>Swallowing difficulties: Ask if the child experiences any discomfort or difficulties when eating or drinking.</li>
            <li>Previous ear, nose, or throat conditions: Knowing the child's medical history can help in diagnosing recurring issues.</li>
            <li>Recent injuries: Any recent head or neck injuries that may impact the ears, nose, or throat.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subheading">Physical Examination</h2>
        <p>Conduct a gentle and child-friendly examination of the ears, nose, and throat, including:</p>
        <strong>Ears</strong>
		<p>Use an otoscope to examine the ear canal and tympanic membrane (eardrum). Look for:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Redness, swelling, or discharge: These may indicate an infection or inflammation in the ear. Redness and swelling may also be a sign of trauma to the ear. Discharge can be a symptom of a ruptured eardrum or an ear infection.</li>
            <li>Tearing or perforation of the eardrum: A ruptured eardrum can cause hearing loss and may require medical treatment.</li>
            <li>Foreign bodies (such as earwax or insects): These can cause irritation, pain, or hearing loss and may need to be removed by a healthcare professional.</li>
            <li>Signs of infection or inflammation: These may include redness, warmth, tenderness, and pain in the ear. The ear may also produce pus or other discharge.</li>
            <li>Abnormalities in hearing: Conduct a hearing test to check for any hearing loss or abnormalities in hearing. This may involve a whisper test or tuning fork test.</li>
        </ul>

		<strong>Nose</strong>
		<p>Examine the nasal passages for:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Signs of obstruction or congestion: These may indicate a blockage in the nasal passages, which can cause difficulty breathing, snoring, or sleep apnea.</li>
            <li>Discharge or bleeding: These can be symptoms of a sinus infection, allergies, or other conditions.</li>
            <li>Deviated septum or other abnormalities: A deviated septum is a common condition in which the nasal septum (the wall that separates the two nostrils) is shifted to one side, making it difficult to breathe through one or both nostrils. Other abnormalities may include nasal polyps, tumors, or cysts.</li>
            <li>Foreign bodies: These can include objects that are stuck in the nose, such as small toys or food particles. Foreign bodies can cause irritation, inflammation, or infection in the nasal passages.</li>
        </ul>

		<strong>Throat</strong>
		<p>Examine the mouth and throat using a tongue depressor and flashlight. Look for:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Redness, swelling, or discharge: These may indicate an infection or inflammation in the throat. Redness and swelling may also be a sign of trauma to the throat. Discharge can be a symptom of a throat infection.</li>
            <li>Tonsillitis or pharyngitis: Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils, while pharyngitis is inflammation of the pharynx (the back of the throat). These conditions can cause sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.</li>
            <li>Ulcers or lesions: These may indicate a viral infection, such as herpes simplex virus (cold sores) or Epstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis). They can also be a sign of oral cancer or other conditions.</li>
            <li>Foreign bodies: These can include objects that are stuck in the throat, such as fish bones or pills. Foreign bodies can cause irritation, inflammation, or infection in the throat.</li>
            <li>Difficulty swallowing: This can be a symptom of a variety of conditions, including throat infections, acid reflux, or neurological disorders.</li>
            <li>Enlarged lymph nodes: These may indicate an infection or inflammation in the throat, or may be a sign of a more serious condition such as lymphoma.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subheading">Diagnostic Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Based on the child's symptoms and examination, diagnostic tests may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hearing assessment: Pediatric audiometry to evaluate hearing ability and detect any issues.</li>
            <li>Imaging studies: Specialized imaging like MRI or CT to assess structures of ears, nose, and throat.</li>
            <li>Endoscopy: A child-friendly procedure using a small camera to examine nasal passages, throat, or vocal cords.</li>
            <li>Swab tests: Collect samples for lab analysis to identify bacterial or viral infections.</li>
        </ul>

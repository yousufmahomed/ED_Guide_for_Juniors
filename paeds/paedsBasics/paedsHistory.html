            <h2 class="subheading">Main Complaint</h2>
            <p>This is a brief statement by the caregiver/parent that describes the reason for seeking medical attention for the child. It is important to document their own words.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try and elicit as many symptoms as you can, as this will help you in diagnosis.</li>
              <li>Be open to listening, the caregiver/parent is not a health professional, and you may have to read between the lines, considering their observations and concerns to understand the child's condition better.</li>
              <li>This may sound intimidating, but as you take more histories and practice, it can be accomplished in a very short time.</li>
              <li>It is also important to understand the circumstances surrounding the illness or injury.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>For example, if the child has an injury, try to gather information about the event that led to the injury to better assess the condition.</li>

            <p>This is a detailed description of the current problem the child is experiencing.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Onset
                <ul>
                  <li>Is this the first time the child is experiencing this problem, or has it occurred before?</li>
                  <li>If it is recurring, try to determine if this episode is similar to others, and if not, how does it differ?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Duration of symptoms</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>If the problem has been present for more than 24 hours, what prompted the caregiver/parent to seek medical help now?</li>
                  <li>Consider factors that led to seeking medical attention, such as changes in severity, lack of improvement with home care, or specific events or symptoms concerning the caregiver/parent.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>
                Severity (Use appropriate scales if needed)
                <ul>
                  <li>Has the severity changed over time, and if so, how?</li>
                  <li>Ask about factors that aggravate or alleviate the symptoms to get a better understanding of the child's condition.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="subheading">Past Medical &amp; Co-Morbid History</h2>
            <p>This includes a summary of the child's past illnesses, surgeries, hospitalizations, and chronic conditions.</p>
            <p>For a more comprehensive look at this aspect, please ask the caregiver/parent about the child's medical history and any significant medical conditions the child has experienced in the past.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Medications</h2>
            <p>Document all current medications the child is taking, including prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, and supplements.</p>
            <p>It is also important to note medications that the child may have taken for long periods before but have now stopped and why.</p> 
            <p>Ask the caregiver/parent about the frequency and dosages of any medications the child is currently or was previously taking.</p>
            <p> <em style="color: brown;">Hint!!</em> If the caregiver/parent has brought the child's medications along (or a prescription or list), thank them for their thoughtfulness, as it builds rapport and makes the consultation go much smoother.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Allergies</h2>
            <p>Document any known allergies the child has. </p>
            <p>Especially important are allergies to medications, food, or other substances that may cause allergic reactions in the child.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Family History</h2>
            <p>Document any significant medical problems or conditions that run in the child's family. </p>
            <p>Ask the caregiver/parent about immediate family members' medical history, especially if there are any conditions that have caused deaths or extended treatments.</p> 
            <p>For example, knowing that the child has a family history of certain diseases can be important for early diagnosis and prevention.</p>

          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Social History</h2>

          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Events Preceding Illness/Injury</h2>
            <p>This is more important for patients where the mechanism of injury or illness seems suspicious or warrants further investigation.</p>
            <p>For example, if a child presents with an injury, ask detailed questions about the events leading up to the injury to rule out any potential child abuse or trauma.</p>

          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Child's Last Meal</h2>

            <p>It is impossible to cover all the intricacies of history taking for pediatric patients on a single page, and you should refer to your Texts and seniors for more information. However, this will provide you with a basic structure that your history should take. <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile"></i> </p>

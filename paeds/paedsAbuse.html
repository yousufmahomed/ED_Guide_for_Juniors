        <p>Child maltreatment is a prevalent issue, with over 650,000 children experiencing abuse or neglect annually in the United States. Emergency physicians play a crucial role in identifying nonaccidental injuries and preventing further harm. Child maltreatment includes neglect (68%), physical abuse (16%), sexual abuse (8%), emotional abuse, and medical child abuse (8%).</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Neglect Evaluation and Management</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Neglect is the most common form of maltreatment, contributing to up to 50% of child maltreatment fatalities.</li>
            <li>Neglect occurs when a caregiver fails to provide basic needs, resulting in serious impairment of the child's health or development.</li>
            <li>Multiple risk factors associated with neglect, such as poverty, parental substance abuse, and mental health issues, should be assessed.</li>
            <li>In the emergency department (ED), recognize when neglect may be a concern, document presenting issues, and trigger a multidisciplinary team approach for investigation and management.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">

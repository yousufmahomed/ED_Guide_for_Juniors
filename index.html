      <h2>How to use this Assistant</h2>
      <article>
        <p>Thank you for using our Assistant, the aim of this is to help students and younger doctors who may be exposed to an emergency setting for the first time. <br></p>
        <p>This Assistant will use various rules and calculations to help guide you while managing your patient and advise on certain actions that can be taken if abnormalities are found.  <br> 
          It is not a substitute for clinical examination and assessment, but rather an Assistant that will quickly bring up values/doses/actions that are common best practice in an ED. <br>
           The calculators will assist you in making various observations and help your clinical decision making.</p>
        <p>Please enjoy using it and I hope it will help you save lives and improve patient care.</p>

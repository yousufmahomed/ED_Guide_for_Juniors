    <h2>The mnemonic D-E-A-T-H is useful; Diabetes, Epilepsy, Asthma, TB, Hypertension/HIV. In this section we've added a few more that can also be asked about.</h2>
    <ul class="links">
      <li style="font-size: larger; text-decoration:underline;">Diabetes Type I</li>
      <p>Try and get a history of medications  and dosages especially</p>
      <p>Previous DKA episodes are very important to note down</p>
      <li style="font-size: larger; text-decoration:underline;">Diabetes Type II</li>
      <p>Try and find out age of onset, and the current medications used are valuable pieces of information.</p>
      <p>Dietary habits, body habitus and family history of the disease should also be asked</p>
      <p>Previous admissions related to the condition are also important.</p>
      <li style="font-size: larger; text-decoration:underline;">Epilepsy</li>
      <p>Age of onset is important.</p>
      <p>You should also try and ask about:- <br>
        Medications used and dosages, <br>
        If it was spontaneous onset or due to trauma. <br>
        Past infections, vascular abnormalities and growths can also be a cause. <br>
        If the patient is on treatment it is important to know how lng since their last seizure</p> 
      <li style="font-size: larger; text-decoration:underline;">Asthma</li>
      <p>Again, you need to ask about medications and dosages</p>
      <p>Age of onset or triggering factors such as infections or exercise.</p>
      <p>Previous admissions and a history of having severe asthma attacks , or even ICU admissions for Status asthmaticus.</p>
      <li style="font-size: larger; text-decoration:underline;">TB</li>
        <ul>
          <li><em style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:larger; font-weight:bolder; color:brown">Important!!!</em> Make sure you can look at the TB DOTS (green) Card , or equivalent in your setting.</li>
          <li>It gives you the timeline, dosages, changes and complications.</li>
          <li>If you cannot see it, make sure you try and get as much information about this from the patient</li>
          <li>And differentiate the type of TB</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Pulmonary</li>

        </ul>
        <li style="font-size: larger; text-decoration:underline;">Hypertension</li>
        <p>Medications and dosages are important.</p>
        <p>If the hypertension has an underlying cause like renal vascular disease, its extremely important to note</p>
        <p>Although, most patients who have secondary HPT they will inform you of the underlying cause.</p>
        <p>Previous admissions and any known target organ damage is important to know.</p>
        <li style="font-size: larger; text-decoration:underline;">HIV</li>
        <p>The doctor may ask whether the patient knows their HIV status, whether they have been tested for HIV in the past, and if they have been diagnosed with HIV previously.</p>
        <p>You may ask about any medications the patient is taking, including antiretroviral therapy (ART) or prophylaxis for HIV.</p>
        <p>You can ask about any allergies the patient has, as some medications used to treat HIV or related infections can cause allergic reactions.</p>
        <p>Compliance is also extremely important</p>

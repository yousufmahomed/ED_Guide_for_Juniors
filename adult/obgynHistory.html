                <h2 class="subheading">Expected Delivery Date Calculator</h2>
                <p>Yes, the expected delivery date (EDD) calculated based on the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) can be used to estimate the expected symphysis-fundal height (SFH).</p>
                <p>The SFH measurement is a non-invasive method used to assess fetal growth during pregnancy. It is measured from the top of the pubic bone (symphysis pubis) to the top of the uterus (fundus) and is usually expressed in centimeters. The measurement is taken regularly during prenatal care appointments to monitor fetal growth and ensure that it is consistent with the gestational age.</p>
                <p>Typically, the SFH measurement is expected to correspond to the gestational age of the fetus. For example, if the EDD calculated based on the LMP is January 8, 2023, then the expected gestational age on August 1, 2022, would be approximately 24 weeks. Therefore, the expected SFH measurement for a 24-week gestational age would be around 24 cm, although this can vary based on factors such as maternal body habitus, fetal position, and amniotic fluid volume.</p>

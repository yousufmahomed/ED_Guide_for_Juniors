                <section class="section">
                  <h3>Example</h3>
                  <p>For example, if a woman has had <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">2</em>  live births but <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">4</em>  total pregnancies we could write it as <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">P2 G4</em> , and because 2 of the pregnancies did not result in live births <br> it would be better to write it as <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">P2 G 2 + 2 </em> </p>
                  <p>If the patient is currently pregnant with her <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">First</em> child we write it as <br> <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">2</em>  live births but <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">P0 G1</em></p>
                  <p>But if she is currently pregnant but has been pregnant before <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">without</em> a live birth, but had an abortion or stillbirths, it would be her second pregnancy so we would then write <br> <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">P0 G 1 + 1</em> or  <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">P0 G2</em>.</p>
                  <p>The + sign just indicates the number of abortions or stillbirths, and provides clarity</p>
                  <p>You can even divide it up further, For example, if a woman has had <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">2</em> live births and <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">2</em> spontaneous abortions, it may be written as <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">"P2 G4 (2-0-2-0)"</em> </p>
                  <p>Where the numbers in parentheses indicate the number of full-term pregnancies, preterm pregnancies, abortions, and living children, respectively.</p>
                  <p>As a final, more Illustrative example of this, <br>A patient with <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">6</em> previous pregnancies.She is Currently Pregnant. So &#40;<em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">6 + 1</em>&#41; <br> Has had <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">3</em> full-term pregnancies, <br> <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">1</em> Preterm pregnancy ,<br>  &amp; <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">2</em> spontaneous abortions, <br> &amp; only <em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">2</em> of her children are alive, would be written as <br><em style="color:red; font-weight:bolder; font-size:larger">P3 G7 &#40; 3-1-2-2 &#41;</em></p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Expected Delivery Date Calculator</h2>
                <p>Yes, the expected delivery date (EDD) calculated based on the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) can be used to estimate the expected symphysis-fundal height (SFH).</p>
                <p>The SFH measurement is a non-invasive method used to assess fetal growth during pregnancy. It is measured from the top of the pubic bone (symphysis pubis) to the top of the uterus (fundus) and is usually expressed in centimeters. The measurement is taken regularly during prenatal care appointments to monitor fetal growth and ensure that it is consistent with the gestational age.</p>
                <p>Typically, the SFH measurement is expected to correspond to the gestational age of the fetus. For example, if the EDD calculated based on the LMP is January 8, 2023, then the expected gestational age on August 1, 2022, would be approximately 24 weeks. Therefore, the expected SFH measurement for a 24-week gestational age would be around 24 cm, although this can vary based on factors such as maternal body habitus, fetal position, and amniotic fluid volume.</p>

            <p>This is a brief statement by the patient that describes the reason for seeking psychiatric attention. It is important to document the patient's own words as this will help you with evaluation. <br> If the patient is incoherent or disorganized, this will be obtained from the co-lateral. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try and elicit as many symptoms as you can, as this will help you in diagnosis</li>
              <li>Be open to listening, the patient is not a health professional generally,and may often be suffering severe or serious mental and you may have to read between the lines, consider social and cultural aspects, and socio-economic impacts, to fully understand why the person is in front of you for this consultation</li>
              <li>This may sound intimidating, but as you take more histories and practice, it can be accomplished in a very short time</li>
              <li>It is also important to understand the circumstances surrounding the current symptoms, for example</li>

                  <li>Compare this to a patient who is non-compliant with medications and is using recreational drugs.</li>
                  <li>Both of these patients will need treatment of their mania, but the approach to each in terms of sedation and immediate anti-psychotic use may be different</li>

            <h2 class="subheading">Mental Status Examination History</h2>
            <p>The Mental Status Exam (MSE) is a structured assessment of an individual's cognitive and emotional functioning. It is a critical tool used in psychiatric evaluations, including those conducted in emergency departments. Here are the components of the MSE, along with their relevance to the emergency department setting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Appearance:</em> The clinician assesses the patient's overall physical appearance, including their grooming, clothing, and hygiene. In the emergency department, this component can provide initial information about the patient's level of self-care and alert the clinician to the possibility of underlying medical issues. <br>
                    In psychiatric assessment, the term "appearance" refers to a patient's overall physical appearance, including grooming, dress, posture, and any physical signs of illness. It can provide valuable information about the patient's general health, self-care, and possible underlying medical issues. However, "abnormal appearances" is not commonly used as a diagnostic category in psychiatry. <br>
                    It's important to note that a person's appearance alone is not enough to make a psychiatric diagnosis. A comprehensive assessment also includes evaluation of behavior, affect, thought processes, and other clinical signs and symptoms. Therefore, it's important to seek help from a qualified mental health professional if you or a loved one are experiencing symptoms of mental illness.</li>
                <li><em>Behavior:</em> The clinician observes the patient's movements and behavior, including motor activity, gestures, and facial expressions. In the emergency department, this component can reveal the patient's level of agitation, restlessness, or psychomotor retardation, which may indicate an acute psychiatric crisis.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Agitation:</em> excessive motor activity, restlessness, pacing, and fidgeting.</li>
                        <li><em>Apathy:</em> lack of interest or motivation in activities that are usually enjoyable or rewarding.</li>
                        <li><em>Catatonia:</em> a state of unresponsiveness to external stimuli, often accompanied by motor immobility or extreme rigidity.</li>
                        <li><em>Delusions:</em> fixed, false beliefs that are not based in reality.</li>
                        <li><em>Disorganized behavior:</em> difficulty with daily activities and routines, poor personal hygiene, and inability to maintain a conversation.</li>
                        <li><em>Hallucinations:</em> sensory experiences that are not actually present, such as seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling things that are not there.</li>
                        <li><em>Impulsivity:</em> acting without forethought or consideration of consequences.</li>
                        <li><em>Mania:</em> a state of elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, grandiosity, and reckless behavior.</li>
                        <li><em>Paranoia:</em> a belief that others are conspiring against or trying to harm the individual.</li>
                        <li><em>Psychomotor retardation:</em> slowed movements and speech, as well as a decreased range of emotional expression.</li>
                        <li><em>Psychosis:</em> a state of loss of contact with reality, often manifested through delusions and/or hallucinations.</li>
                        <li><em>Suicidal behavior:</em> self-harming or suicidal thoughts, gestures, or attempts.</li>
                        <li>These behaviors are often indicative of underlying psychiatric disorders and can be a signal that the individual requires intervention and treatment. It's worth noting that these behaviors can manifest in a variety of ways and with varying degrees of severity, and that it is important for healthcare providers to conduct a thorough assessment and evaluation to determine the appropriate course of action.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><em>Speech:</em> The clinician evaluates the patient's rate, tone,volume and content of speech. In the emergency department, this component can provide insight into the patient's level of coherence and thought organization, which can aid in differential diagnosis.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Flight of ideas:</em> rapid, unconnected, and sometimes incoherent speech that is difficult to follow.</li>

                        <li><em>Pressured speech:</em> speech that is rapid, loud, and difficult to interrupt or control.</li>
                        <li><em>Circumstantial speech:</em> speech that is overly detailed and goes off on tangents before finally returning to the original point.</li>
                        <li><em>Tangential speech:</em> speech that goes off on tangents and never returns to the original point.</li>
                        <li><em>Echolalia:</em> the repetition of words or phrases spoken by others.</li>
                        <li><em>Mutism:</em> the absence of speech, or a refusal to speak.</li>
                        <li><em>Thought blocking:</em> a sudden interruption in speech, often due to the inability to recall a word or phrase.</li>
                        <li><em>Stuttering:</em> a speech disorder characterized by the repetition or prolongation of sounds, words, or syllables.</li>
                        <li>It's worth noting that these speech patterns can be indicative of underlying psychiatric or neurological disorders, and it's important to conduct a thorough assessment and evaluation to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In some cases, speech patterns may be related to other medical conditions, such as stroke or traumatic brain injury, and may require different interventions.</li>

                    </ul>
                <li><em>Mood:</em> The clinician assesses the patient's reported emotional state, including any apparent fluctuations or changes. In the emergency department, this component can help identify patients who may require immediate intervention for suicidality, severe depression, or mania.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Euphoria: </em>  an elevated or exaggerated mood that is not consistent with the individual's circumstances.</li>
                        <li><em>Dysphoria:</em> a state of feeling sad, dissatisfied, or unhappy.</li>
                        <li><em>Anxiety:</em> a state of feeling worried, nervous, or apprehensive, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as sweating or rapid heart rate.</li>
                        <li><em>Depression:</em> a state of feeling sad, hopeless, or despondent, often accompanied by changes in appetite, sleep, and energy levels.</li>
                        <li><em>Irritability:</em> a state of feeling easily annoyed, angry, or frustrated.</li>
                        <li><em>Apathy: </em>  a lack of interest or motivation in activities that are usually enjoyable or rewarding.</li>
                        <li><em>Anhedonia:</em>  attempts the inability to feel pleasure or enjoy activities that are usually pleasurable or enjoyable.</li>
                        <li><em>Mania:</em> a state of elevated or irritable mood, increased energy, decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, grandiosity, and reckless behavior.</li>
                        <li><em>Hypomania:</em> a milder form of mania, characterized by elevated or irritable mood and increased energy.</li>
                        <li><em>Mixed states:</em> a state of having both manic and depressive symptoms at the same time.</li>
                        <li>It's worth noting that these mood patterns can be indicative of underlying psychiatric disorders, and it's important to conduct a thorough assessment and evaluation to determine the appropriate course of treatment. In some cases, mood patterns may be related to other medical conditions, such as thyroid disorders or hormonal imbalances, and may require different interventions.</li>

                    </ul>
                <li><em>Affect:</em> The clinician observes the patient's emotional expression, including facial expressions and body language.

                        <li><em>Euphoric affect:</em> an elevated and exaggerated mood, often seen in manic episodes of bipolar disorder.</li>
                        <li><em>Dysphoric affect: </em> a negative and unpleasant mood, often seen in depression and anxiety disorders.</li>
                        <li><em>Anxious affect:</em> a state of heightened apprehension, worry, and tension, often seen in anxiety disorders.</li>
                        <li><em>Irritable affect:</em> a state of persistent anger, irritability, and hostility, often seen in mood disorders and personality disorders.</li>
                        <li><em>Agitated affect:</em> a state of restlessness and heightened arousal, often seen in anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.</li>
                        <li>These are just a few examples, and there can be significant overlap between different affect patterns. A comprehensive psychiatric assessment would involve observing and assessing a person's affect over time, and in different situations.</li>

                        <li><em>Delirium:</em> a disturbance in consciousness and attention that develops over a short period of time and can fluctuate throughout the day, often due to an underlying medical condition or medication use.</li>
                        <li><em>Dementia:</em> a progressive decline in cognitive function, including memory, language, and problem-solving skills, often due to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.</li>
                        <li><em>Amnesia:</em> a loss of memory or inability to form new memories, often due to head injury, disease, or substance abuse.</li>
                        <li><em>Confabulation:</em> a disturbance in memory, characterized by the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories.</li>
                        <li><em>Disorientation:</em> confusion about time, place, or person, often due to acute medical or psychiatric illness.</li>
                        <li><em>Agnosia:</em> difficulty recognizing or identifying objects, people, or sounds despite having normal sensory function.</li>
                        <li><em>Apraxia:</em> difficulty with motor planning or executing purposeful movements, despite having normal motor function.</li>
                        <li><em>Acalculia:</em> difficulty with mathematical calculations, often due to brain injury or disease.</li>
                        <li><em>Alexia:</em> difficulty reading or comprehending written language, often due to brain injury or disease.</li>
                        <li><em>Agraphia:</em> difficulty writing or expressing thoughts in writing, often due to brain injury or disease.</li>
                        <li>These are just a few examples, and there can be significant overlap between different types of cognitive disorders. A comprehensive psychiatric assessment would involve observing and assessing a person's cognitive function over time, and in different situations.</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to these components, the clinician may also assess the patient's judgment, insight, and impulse control. In the emergency department, these components can help the clinician determine the patient's capacity for self-care and identify any potential safety concerns.</p>
            <p>It's worth noting that the MSE is not a definitive diagnostic tool but rather a structured method of evaluating and documenting an individual's mental status. It can help guide the clinician's evaluation and aid in diagnosis, treatment planning, and ongoing care.</p>

            <h2 class="subheading">Risk Assessment</h2>
            <p>Assess the patient's level of risk for self-harm or harm to others, and develop a safety plan if necessary.</p>
            <p>How do I manage a violent, highly aggressive or armed Psychiatric Patient!!</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ensure the safety of all staff and patients in the area: Immediately call for assistance and clear the area of any unnecessary staff or patients who are not essential to the patient's care. If the patient is armed, notify security and law enforcement.</li>
                    <li>Assess the situation and the patient's mental status: Determine the nature and severity of the patient's symptoms, level of agitation or aggression, and any potential triggers or stressors.</li>
                    <li>Establish a rapport and engage the patient: Try to establish a positive and supportive rapport with the patient, and use clear and direct communication to de-escalate the situation. Validate the patient's feelings and acknowledge their perspective, and encourage them to express their concerns and needs.</li>
                    <li>Use verbal and nonverbal de-escalation techniques: Use a calm and assertive tone of voice, maintain eye contact, and use nonthreatening body language. Avoid challenging or confrontational statements, and use active listening skills to demonstrate empathy and understanding.</li>
                    <li>Consider medication: If the patient is not responding to verbal de-escalation techniques and poses an imminent threat to themselves or others, consider using medications to control their agitation and aggression. This should only be done by a qualified healthcare professional, and with appropriate informed consent and documentation.</li>
                    <li>Use physical restraints as a last resort: If the patient continues to pose a danger to themselves or others, or if they are at risk of leaving the Emergency Department, consider using physical restraints. This should only be done as a last resort, and with appropriate informed consent, documentation, and monitoring.</li>
                    <li>Continue to monitor and re-evaluate the patient's condition: Once the patient has been stabilized, continue to monitor their condition and re-evaluate their mental status and treatment plan. Ensure that appropriate follow-up care and referrals are arranged, and that the patient is discharged in a safe and appropriate manner.</li>
                    <li>It's important to note that the management of aggressive or violent patients requires specialized training and expertise. Emergency Department staff should receive regular training in de-escalation techniques and the use of physical restraints, and have access to appropriate resources and support. Additionally, each patient's situation is unique and requires an individualized approach, so the above action plan should be considered as a general guideline and modified as needed based on the specific circumstances of the patient and the Emergency Department.</li>

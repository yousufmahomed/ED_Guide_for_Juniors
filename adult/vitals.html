                <h2 class="subheading">Blood pressure</h2>
                <p>Normal blood pressure range: A normal blood pressure reading for adults is generally considered to be below 120/80 mmHg.</p>
                <p> <em style="font-size: larger; color:red">Hypertension:</em>  Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a medical condition where the force of blood against the walls of the arteries is consistently elevated. The American Heart Association classifies hypertension as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em style="font-size: larger; color:green">Stage 1 hypertension:</em> Systolic blood pressure (the top number) is between 130-139 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (the bottom number) is between 80-89 mmHg.</li>
                    <li><em style="font-size: larger;color:green">Stage 2 hypertension:</em> Systolic blood pressure is 140 mmHg or higher, or diastolic blood pressure is 90 mmHg or higher.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> <em style="font-size: larger; color:red">Hypertensive urgency:</em> Hypertensive urgency refers to severely elevated blood pressure (usually systolic blood pressure of 180 mmHg or higher and/or diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or higher) without any acute target organ damage. While there is a need for prompt intervention to lower blood pressure, there is no immediate risk of organ damage.</p>
                <p> <em style="font-size: larger;color:red">Hypertensive emergency: </em>Hypertensive emergency is a medical emergency that occurs when severely elevated blood pressure causes acute target organ damage, such as damage to the brain, heart, kidneys, or other organs. This is defined as blood pressure of 180/120 mmHg or higher with evidence of organ damage.</p>

                <h2 class="subheading">Pulse or Heart Rate</h2>
                <p>This is measured using a pulse oximeter or by palpating the radial artery at the wrist. It provides information about the heart's functioning and can help to identify any arrhythmias.</p>
                <p>The normal resting heart rate for adults is typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute (bpm). However, individual heart rates can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, fitness level, and overall health.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em style="font-size: larger; color:red">Tachycardia:</em> This is a condition where the heart rate is consistently above 100 bpm at rest. Tachycardia can be caused by factors such as stress, anxiety, medication, or underlying health conditions such as heart disease, thyroid problems, or anemia.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em style="font-size: larger; color:green">Sinus Tachycardia:</em> This is a normal response to exercise, stress, or other factors that increase the body's demand for oxygen. In sinus tachycardia, the heart rate is elevated, but the heart's rhythm is regular.</li>
                            <li><em style="font-size: larger; color:green">Supraventricular Tachycardia:</em>  This is an abnormal rhythm that originates from the atria or the atrioventricular node. SVT can cause the heart to beat rapidly and irregularly.</li>
                            <li><em style="font-size: larger; color:green">Ventricular Tachycardia:</em>  This is an abnormal rhythm that originates from the ventricles. Ventricular tachycardia can be life-threatening and can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest.</li>

                            <li><em style="font-size: larger; color:green">Sinus Bradycardia:</em>  This is a normal rhythm where the heart rate is slower than normal but the rhythm is regular. Sinus bradycardia can be a result of being physically fit, certain medications, or underlying medical conditions.</li>
                            <li><em style="font-size: larger; color:green">Atrioventricular Block:</em>  This is a condition where there is a delay or blockage in the electrical signals that control the heart's rhythm. Atrioventricular block can cause the heart rate to slow down or become irregular.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Arrhythmias: Arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that can cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. Arrhythmias can be caused by factors such as heart disease, high blood pressure, or electrolyte imbalances.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Ventricular fibrillation: This is a life-threatening rhythm where the ventricles quiver instead of contracting properly, which can lead to sudden cardiac arrest and death.</li>
                            <li>Supraventricular arrhythmias: These are abnormal rhythms that originate from the atria or the atrioventricular node. Supraventricular arrhythmias can cause the heart to beat rapidly and irregularly.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Atrial fibrillation: Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a common arrhythmia where the heart beats irregularly and rapidly. This can increase the risk of blood clots and stroke.</li>
                    <li>Premature ventricular contractions: Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra heartbeats that originate in the ventricles. They can be caused by factors such as stress, caffeine, or underlying heart disease.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Isolated PVCs: These are single PVCs that occur occasionally and do not require treatment.</li>
                            <li>Frequent PVCs: These occur more often and can be a sign of underlying heart disease or other health conditions.</li>

                <h2 class="subheading">Respiratory Rate</h2>
                <p>This is measured by counting the number of breaths an individual takes per minute. </p>
                <p>It helps to identify any breathing difficulties or respiratory distress.</p>
                <p>The normal respiratory rate for adults is typically between 12 to 20 breaths per minute at rest. However, individual respiratory rates can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, physical activity, and overall health.</p>
                <p>Respiratory distress is a condition where an individual is having difficulty breathing or is experiencing a decrease in the amount of oxygen in their blood. Respiratory distress can be classified into three categories based on severity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mild respiratory distress: In mild respiratory distress, an individual may have difficulty breathing, but they can still speak in full sentences. They may exhibit symptoms such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, or shallow breathing.</li>
                    <li>Moderate respiratory distress: In moderate respiratory distress, an individual may be able to speak in short phrases, but they are likely to have difficulty breathing. They may exhibit symptoms such as rapid and shallow breathing, wheezing, or use of accessory muscles to breathe.</li>
                    <li>Severe respiratory distress: In severe respiratory distress, an individual may not be able to speak at all and may exhibit symptoms such as gasping for air, flaring of the nostrils, and retractions (pulling in of the muscles between the ribs or in the neck). They may have a bluish tint to their skin, indicating that they are not getting enough oxygen.</li>

                <h2 class="subheading">Oxygen Saturation (02 SATS)</h2>
                <p> A normal oxygen saturation level is usually between 95-100%, but this can vary depending on your health status and other factors. </p>
                <p>Oxygen saturation is a measure of the amount of oxygen that is bound to hemoglobin molecules in your blood, expressed as a percentage. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. When you breathe in air, oxygen enters your lungs and diffuses into your bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules. The oxygenated hemoglobin then travels to your body's tissues, where it releases the oxygen so that it can be used for energy production.</p>
                <p>TA pulse oximeter is normally used to measure 02 Saturation levels, it will also display heart rate</p>
                <p>It's important to note that pulse oximeters have some limitations. They may not work well if there is poor circulation to the area being monitored, or if the sensor is placed on an area with a lot of movement or motion. They can also be affected by bright light, such as sunlight or fluorescent lights, which can interfere with the accuracy of the readings. In addition, pulse oximeters may not be as accurate in people with certain medical conditions, such as anemia, hypotension, or peripheral vascular disease, which can affect the amount of light that is absorbed by the blood.</p>
                <p>A normal oxygen saturation level is typically between 95-100%. If your oxygen saturation level falls below 90%, it is considered low and may indicate that you are not getting enough oxygen to your body's tissues. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as lung disease, heart disease, anemia, or high altitude.</p>
                <ul>Hypoxia Grading</ul>
                    <li>Normal oxygen saturation: Oxygen saturation levels of 95-100% are considered normal.</li>
                    <p>No specific treatment is necessary.</p>
                    <li>Mild hypoxia: Oxygen saturation levels of 91-94% are considered mild hypoxia. At this level, the body is still able to function normally, but the patient may experience symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, or confusion.</li>
                    <p>In most cases, supplemental oxygen therapy is recommended to increase the patient's oxygen saturation level. This may be administered via a nasal cannula or a face mask. The underlying cause of hypoxia should also be evaluated and treated, if possible.</p>
                    <li>Moderate hypoxia: Oxygen saturation levels of 86-90% are considered moderate hypoxia. At this level, the body may start to experience more serious symptoms, such as rapid heart rate, respiratory distress, or chest pain.</li>
                    <p> Supplemental oxygen therapy is usually necessary to raise the patient's oxygen saturation level. Depending on the severity of the hypoxia, high-flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation may be necessary. The underlying cause of hypoxia should be evaluated and treated, if possible.</p>
                    <li>Severe hypoxia: Oxygen saturation levels of less than 85% are considered severe hypoxia. At this level, the body is not getting enough oxygen to function properly, and the patient may experience symptoms such as cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin), confusion, or loss of consciousness.</li>
                    <p>This is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Supplemental oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, or mechanical ventilation may be necessary to increase the patient's oxygen saturation level. In some cases, medications such as bronchodilators or corticosteroids may also be used to help open the airways or reduce inflammation in the lungs. The underlying cause of hypoxia should be evaluated and treated as quickly as possible.</p>

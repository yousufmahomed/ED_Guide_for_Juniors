        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ensure Patient Safety:</strong> Ensure the patient's safety and well-being. If they are in immediate danger or experiencing medical distress, provide necessary medical attention and consider involving law enforcement or protective services.</li>
            <li><strong>Private Environment:</strong> Create a safe and private environment for the patient to speak openly about their experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Trauma-Informed Care:</strong> Approach the patient with sensitivity and empathy, recognizing the potential trauma they have experienced. Use open-ended and non-judgmental questions.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Examination:</strong> Conduct a thorough medical examination, documenting all physical injuries and forensic evidence. Preserve any clothing or items the patient provides as evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Forensic Evidence Collection:</strong> If the assault occurred within the past 72 hours, discuss the option of collecting forensic evidence, such as swabs and samples. Ensure the patient understands the process and their rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Psychological Support:</strong> Offer immediate psychological support to the patient. Consider involving a social worker or counselor experienced in trauma support.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Treatment:</strong> Provide necessary medical treatment for injuries and any immediate health concerns. Offer prophylactic treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy prevention if applicable.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> In cases of sexual assault, explain the option of reporting to law enforcement. If the patient consents to reporting, assist in contacting the police or providing a rape kit examination.</li>

            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Thoroughly document all findings, injuries, conversations, and assessments in the patient's medical record.</li>
            <li><strong>Empower Choice:</strong> Respect the patient's autonomy and decisions regarding reporting and legal action. Empower them to make choices prioritizing their well-being.</li>
            <li><strong>Preserve Evidence:</strong> If the patient decides to report the assault, work closely with law enforcement to collect and preserve necessary evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Patient Education:</strong> Educate the patient about the importance of preserving evidence and maintaining their own well-being.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Be culturally sensitive and aware of the patient's background and potential barriers to seeking help.</li>

            <p>This is a brief statement by the patient that describes the reason for seeking medical attention. It is important to document the patient's own words.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try and elicit as many symptoms as you can, as this will help you in diagnosis</li>
              <li>Be open to listening, the patient is not a health professional generally, and you may have to read between the lines, consider social and cultural aspects, and socio-economic impacts, to fully understand why the person is in front of you for this consultation</li>
              <li>This may sound intimidating, but as you take more histories and practice, it can be accomplished in a very short time</li>

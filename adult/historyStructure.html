            <p>This is a brief statement by the patient that describes the reason for seeking medical attention. It is important to document the patient's own words.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Try and elicit as many symptoms as you can, as this will help you in diagnosis</li>
              <li>Be open to listening, the patient is not a health professional generally, and you may have to read between the lines, consider social and cultural aspects, and socio-economic impacts, to fully understand why the person is in front of you for this consultation</li>
              <li>This may sound intimidating, but as you take more histories and practice, it can be accomplished in a very short time</li>
              <li>It is also important to understand the circumstances surrounding the illness, for example</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>There is a big difference between two patients who have an injured ankle, where the first slipped on a wet floor and the second felt dizzy, fainted with a chest pain and woke up with a swollen ankle!!</li>
                  <li>Your approach to investigating them will be completely different!</li>

                      <li>The factors that can make someone come in</li>

            <p>This includes a summary of the patient's past illnesses, surgeries, hospitalizations, and chronic conditions. </p>
            <p>For a more comprehensive look at this aspect please go to this <a href="/adult/coMorbid.html" class="emphasis-link"> <em>Section</em> </a> dedicated to its discussion</p> 
          </section>
          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Medications</h2>
            <p>Document all current medications the patient is taking. </p>
            <p>It is also important to note medications that were taken for long periods before, but have now stopped and why.</p> 
            <p>While most patients may struggle to know doses, you should try and get a clear picture from them about frequency of use (twice a day, three times a day etc) and which illnesses were being treated. </p>
            <p> <em style="color: brown;">Hint!!</em> If your patient has brought their medication along (or a prescription or list), thank them for their thoughtfulness, I have found it builds instant rapport and makes the rest of the consultation go much easier.</p>
            <p>In fact, any opportunity to show appreciation for the actions of the patient or caregiver or parent, makes a <em style="color: brown;">Huge</em> impact on their impression of you, and makes you seem empathetic and sympathetic simultaneously!!</p>
            <p>Go to this <a href="/adult/commonMeds.html" class="emphasis-link"> <em>Page</em> </a> for a list of commonly used medications and dosages to assist you.</p>

            <h2 class="subheading">Allergies</h2>
            <p>Document any known allergies the patient has. </p>
            <p>Especially important in the ED are allergies to :-</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Penicillin</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is important to note that most penicillin based antibiotics do elicit a rash on first usage, but a true allergy causes a more severe anaphylaxis reaction.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Cephalosporins</li>
              <li>Sulfur</li>
              <li>ACE Inhibitors</li>
              <li>Anaesthetic reactions (especially if patient needs emergency surgery)</li>

            <h2 class="subheading">Family History</h2>
            <p>Document any significant medical problems or conditions that run in the patient's family. </p>
            <p>The co-morbid conditions will give you a good guide on family history as well.</p>
            <p>But remember, you are trying to get  information on diseases that have caused deaths and extended treatments for immediate family.</p> 
            <p>It is important to know that a patient with a purulent breast mass has two sisters being treated for breast cancer!!</p>
            <p>This is something that comes with practice, but if you are starting your medical journey, take time to ask as much as possible.</p>

          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Social History</h2>

          <section class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Events preceding illness/ injury.</h2>
            <p>This is more important for patients where the mechanism of injury seems suspicious or you suspect that another illness may be precipitating current problems. </p>
            <p>As an example, a child presents with a spiral fracture of the femur, but caregiver insists they fell from the bed. This could indicate Child abuse!</p>
            <p>Or you could look at the example given before of the two patients with ankle injuries but completely different events led up to the injury.</p>
            <p>This can also help you later on if cases go to court or evolve into more complex issues.</p>

          This is a brief statement, in the patient’s own words, describing why they
          came to the Emergency Department.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to record it as a short phrase in quotes, e.g. <em>“Severe chest pain since this morning.”</em></li>
          <li>Elicit as many symptoms as possible – patients often under-report important details initially.</li>
          <li>Be open to listening – patients are usually not medically trained. You may need to “read between the lines” and consider social, cultural and socio-economic factors.</li>
          <li>Try to understand the circumstances around the illness or injury:
            <ul>
              <li>There is a big difference between a sprained ankle from slipping on a wet floor and an ankle injury after syncope with chest pain and collapse – your approach and urgency will be very different.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Onset</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Is this the first episode (index presentation) or a recurrence?</li>
              <li>If recurrent, is this episode similar to previous ones? If not, what is different?</li>
            </ul>

              <li>When did the symptoms start, and how have they evolved over time?</li>
              <li>If symptoms started more than 24 hours ago, ask: <em>“What made you decide to come in today?”</em></li>
              <li>Common reasons for finally coming in:
                <ul>
                  <li>Change or worsening in severity.</li>
                  <li>Home or over-the-counter remedies no longer helping.</li>
                  <li>New associated symptoms (e.g. shortness of breath, fever, weakness).</li>
                  <li>Social issues (e.g. an abusive partner, lack of support at home).</li>

              <li>Use a pain scale if needed, e.g. 0–10 (<a href="/adult/painScale.html" class="emphasis-link">Pain Scale</a>).</li>
              <li>Has the severity changed? Over what time-frame?</li>
              <li>Does anything make it better or worse (position, exertion, meals, movement)?</li>
              <li>How is it affecting function – can they walk, work, sleep, eat?</li>

              <li>Location and radiation (e.g. chest pain radiating to jaw or left arm).</li>
              <li>Associated symptoms – fever, weight loss, nausea/vomiting, dyspnoea, palpitations, neurological symptoms, urinary or bowel changes, etc.</li>

              <li><strong>Ideas:</strong> What does the patient think might be wrong?</li>
              <li><strong>Concerns:</strong> What are they most worried about (heart attack, cancer, work, family)?</li>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cardiorespiratory: chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations, orthopnoea, cough, haemoptysis.</li>
          <li>Abdominal: pain, nausea/vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, bleeding per rectum, jaundice.</li>
          <li>Neurological: headaches, seizures, weakness, sensory changes, speech or vision changes.</li>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Medications</h2>
        <p>
          Document all current medications, including over-the-counter and traditional remedies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Note chronic medications (names if possible), dose and frequency.</li>
          <li>Ask about medication changes, recent new drugs and reasons for stopping any chronic medications.</li>
          <li>Try to clarify what each medication is for – it helps confirm co-morbid conditions.</li>
          <li>If the patient has brought medication boxes, prescriptions or a list, thank them – it builds rapport and improves accuracy.</li>

        <h2 class="subheading">Allergies and Adverse Reactions</h2>
        <p>
          Document any known allergies and serious adverse drug reactions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Common important allergies in the ED:
            <ul>
              <li>Penicillins and other beta-lactams (note difference between mild rash and anaphylaxis).</li>
              <li>Cephalosporins.</li>
              <li>Sulfonamides.</li>
              <li>Anaesthetic reactions (especially relevant if theatre is likely).</li>
              <li>ACE inhibitors (angio-oedema, cough).</li>
              <li>Food and latex allergies (e.g. eggs, nuts, shellfish if relevant).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Clarify <strong>what happened</strong> – rash, swelling, anaphylaxis, GI upset, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Family History</h2>
        <p>
          Ask about significant illnesses in immediate family members, especially conditions
          that start young or cause disability/death.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Focus on first-degree relatives with heart disease, stroke, diabetes, hypertension, cancers, clotting disorders or sudden deaths.</li>
          <li>Relate it to the current problem – for example, a patient with a breast lump and two sisters treated for breast cancer.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Social History</h2>
        <p>
          Social context often explains why the patient presents in a particular way and
          influences your management plan.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Occupation and daily activities (e.g. heavy lifting, night shifts, high stress).</li>
          <li>Living situation and support – who is at home, caring responsibilities, safety concerns.</li>
          <li>Substance use: smoking, alcohol, recreational drugs.
            <ul>
              <li>For smoking, see the <a href="/adult/packYears.html" class="emphasis-link"><em>Pack Years</em></a> calculator.</li>
            </ul>

          <li>Financial and transport issues that may affect follow-up or medication adherence.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Events Preceding Illness or Injury</h2>
        <p>
          This is particularly important where the mechanism of injury is unclear or suspicious,
          or when you suspect another illness triggered the current problem.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clarify exactly what happened before and during the event (collapse, loss of consciousness, seizure activity, chest pain, headache, etc.).</li>
          <li>Look for red flags for non-accidental injury:
            <ul>
              <li>Injuries inconsistent with the history (e.g. spiral femur fracture in a child said to have “fallen off the bed”).</li>
              <li>Multiple injuries in different stages of healing.</li>
              <li>Delays in presentation or changing stories.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Document these details clearly – they may be vital if the case goes to court or to child-protection services.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Last Meal (Time of Last Oral Intake)</h2>
        <p>
          Especially important if the patient may need anaesthesia or emergency surgery.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ask when they last ate or drank anything (including water, chewing gum, milk, alcohol).</li>
          <li>Record the approximate time and type of intake in the notes.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Summarising and Closing the History</h2>
        <p>
          At the end of the history:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Briefly summarise the main points back to the patient to check you have understood correctly.</li>
          <li>Ask if there is <strong>anything else</strong> worrying them that you have not yet discussed.</li>
          <li>Explain your next steps (examination, tests, possible treatments) and obtain consent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          It is impossible to cover every nuance of history taking on a single page. Use this as
          a basic structure, and continue to learn from your texts, seniors and your own
          experience. With practice, a good ED history becomes focused, efficient and
          patient-centred. <i class="fa-solid fa-face-smile"></i>

        <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>A hand examination is performed in the medical setting to assess for any injuries or abnormalities in the hand, including the palm, dorsum of hand, fingers, and thumb. This examination is typically done on patients who have sustained a hand injury or are experiencing hand pain or dysfunction, and is essential for identifying any potential fractures, ligament injuries, or nerve damage.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
        <p>The hand examination involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inspect the hand for any obvious abnormalities or deformities, such as swelling, bruising, or lacerations. Check for any penetrating injuries or foreign objects that may have entered the hand.</li>
            <li>Palpate the hand, assessing for tenderness, warmth, and swelling. Check for any bony abnormalities or crepitus.</li>
            <li>Assess the range of motion of the hand, including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction of the wrist, fingers, and thumb. Ask the patient to move their hand in each direction, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
            <li>Perform specific tests to assess for specific injuries or conditions, such as the Finkelstein's test for De Quervain's tenosynovitis, or the Tinel's sign for carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
            <li>Perform a neurovascular examination, assessing for any signs of nerve or blood vessel injury. Test the patient's sensation and reflexes, as well as their pulse and blood pressure in the affected hand or fingers.</li>
            <li>Assess for any deformities or abnormalities in the hand and fingers, such as swelling, bruising, or discoloration. Check for any penetrating injuries or foreign objects that may have entered the hand.</li>
            <li>Assess the range of motion of the fingers and thumb, including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Ask the patient to move their fingers and thumb in each direction, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
            <li>Perform specific tests to assess for specific injuries or conditions, such as the Allen's test for arterial insufficiency or the Froment's sign for ulnar nerve palsy.</li>
            <li>Assess for any signs of tendonitis, such as pain, swelling, tenderness, and limited range of motion. Check for any clicking or popping sensations that may be present.</li>
            <li>Check for any signs of arthritis, such as pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited range of motion. Ask the patient about any history of autoimmune disease or family history of arthritis.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the grip strength of the hand, asking the patient to squeeze your hand as tightly as possible. This can help assess for any weakness or motor deficits.</li>
            <li>Perform any additional tests or maneuvers as indicated by the patient's symptoms or medical history. This may include provocative testing for specific conditions, such as De Quervain's tenosynovitis or trigger finger.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Imaging studies, such as X-rays or MRI, may be ordered if the examination reveals any abnormalities or if further evaluation is needed.</p>

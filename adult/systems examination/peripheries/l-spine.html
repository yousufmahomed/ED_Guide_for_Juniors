    <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>A lumbar spine examination is performed in the emergency department to assess for any injuries or abnormalities in the lower back and spinal cord. This examination is typically done on patients who have been involved in a traumatic event or have back pain, and is essential for identifying any potential spinal cord injuries.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
    <p>The lumbar spine examination involves the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inspect the lower back for any obvious abnormalities or deformities, such as swelling, bruising, or lacerations. Check for any penetrating injuries or foreign objects that may have entered the back.</li>
        <li>Palpate the lumbar spine, assessing for tenderness, muscle spasm, and bony abnormalities. Apply gentle pressure to the spinous processes of each vertebra, checking for any pain or discomfort.</li>
        <li>Assess the range of motion of the lumbar spine, including flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending. Ask the patient to move their back in each direction, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
        <li>Perform a neurologic examination, assessing for any motor or sensory deficits, reflexes, and signs of spinal cord injury. Check for any weakness or loss of sensation in the legs, abnormal reflexes, or bowel or bladder dysfunction. Use the following steps:</li>
        <ol type="a">
        <li><strong>Muscle Strength:</strong> Assess muscle strength of the legs by having the patient flex and extend their knees and ankles against resistance. Evaluate for any weakness, tremors, or spasms.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensory Exam:</strong> Check for any sensory deficits in the legs. Test for light touch sensation using a cotton swab, and pinprick sensation using a sharp object.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflexes:</strong> Test for patellar and Achilles reflexes. Tap the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer while the patient's leg is hanging freely, and observe for a reflexive extension of the leg. Similarly, strike the Achilles tendon with the hammer while the patient's foot is dorsiflexed, and observe for plantar flexion of the foot.</li>
        <li><strong>Bowel and Bladder Function:</strong> Ask the patient if they have had any changes in their bowel or bladder function, such as incontinence or difficulty emptying their bladder. These symptoms may indicate spinal cord injury or compression.</li>
        </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="subheading">Indications for Imaging Studies</h2>
            <p>Imaging studies may be indicated for the following patients:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Indication</th>
                    <th>Imaging Study</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Signs or symptoms of spinal cord injury</td>
                    <td>MRI of the lumbar spine</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Progressive or severe neurologic symptoms</td>
                    <td>MRI of the lumbar spine</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Suspected infection or tumor</td>
                    <td>MRI of the lumbar spine</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Severe or persistent back pain</td>
                    <td>X-ray or CT scan of the lumbar spine</td>
                </tr>

            <h2 class="subheading">Management of Lumbar Spine Injuries</h2>
            <p>The management of lumbar spine injuries depends on the severity and underlying cause of the injury. In general, management strategies may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rest and activity modification: Rest and avoiding activities that worsen the pain or symptoms may be recommended initially. Bed rest is generally not recommended beyond a day or two as it can delay recovery.</li>
                <li>Pain management: Pain medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, or opioids may be used to manage pain.</li>
                <li>Physical therapy: Once the acute symptoms have subsided, physical therapy may be recommended to improve strength, flexibility, and function.</li>
                <li>Injections: Epidural steroid injections may be used to reduce inflammation and pain in the lumbar spine.</li>
                <li>Surgery: Surgery may be necessary in cases of severe or progressive neurologic deficits or spinal instability.</li>
            </ul>

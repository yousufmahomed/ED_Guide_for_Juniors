        <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>A shoulder examination is performed in the emergency department to evaluate for injuries or abnormalities in the shoulder joint and surrounding structures. This examination is typically done on patients who have pain or swelling in the shoulder, and is essential for identifying any potential joint dislocations or fractures.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
        <p>The shoulder examination involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inspect the shoulder for any obvious deformities, such as swelling, bruising, or lacerations. Check for any penetrating injuries or foreign objects that may have entered the shoulder joint.</li>
            <li>Palpate the shoulder joint, assessing for tenderness, muscle spasm, and bony abnormalities. Apply gentle pressure to the bones and muscles surrounding the shoulder joint, checking for any pain or discomfort.</li>
            <li>Assess the range of motion of the shoulder joint, including forward flexion, abduction, internal and external rotation, and adduction. Ask the patient to move their arm in each direction, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
            <li>Perform a neurologic examination, assessing for any motor or sensory deficits, reflexes, and signs of nerve damage. Check for any weakness or loss of sensation in the arm, abnormal reflexes, or abnormal muscle tone.</li>
            <li>Consider imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI, or ultrasound, to further evaluate any suspected injuries or abnormalities. Imaging may be particularly important in patients with suspected fractures, dislocations, or rotator cuff tears.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Indications for Imaging Studies</h2>
      <p>Imaging studies may be indicated for the following patients:</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Indication</th>
          <th>Imaging Study</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Suspected fracture or dislocation</td>
          <td>X-rays, CT scan</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Suspected rotator cuff tear</td>
          <td>X-rays, MRI, ultrasound</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Unexplained shoulder pain or weakness</td>
          <td>X-rays, MRI, ultrasound</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>History of previous shoulder injury</td>
          <td>X-rays, MRI, ultrasound</td>

      <h2 class="subheading">Management of Shoulder Injuries</h2>
      <p>The management of shoulder injuries depends on the severity and type of injury. In general, management strategies may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rest: Resting the affected shoulder and avoiding activities that aggravate the injury</li>
        <li>Ice and heat therapy: Applying ice or heat to the shoulder can help relieve pain and inflammation</li>
        <li>Pain management: Over-the-counter pain relievers or prescription medications may be used to manage pain</li>
        <li>Physical therapy: Once the injury has stabilized, physical therapy may be recommended to improve range of motion and strength</li>
        <li>Surgery: Surgery may be necessary in some cases, such as for severe rotator cuff tears or dislocations that do not respond to other treatments</li>
        <li>Monitoring: Regular monitoring and imaging may be necessary to ensure that the injury is healing properly and to detect any complications</li>
      </ul>

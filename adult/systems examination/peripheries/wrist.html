        <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>A wrist examination is performed in the emergency department to assess for any injuries or abnormalities in the wrist and hand. This examination is typically done on patients who have sustained a wrist injury or are experiencing wrist pain, and is essential for identifying any potential fractures or ligament injuries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
        <p>The wrist examination involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inspect the wrist for any obvious abnormalities or deformities, such as swelling, bruising, or lacerations. Check for any penetrating injuries or foreign objects that may have entered the wrist.</li>
            <li>Palpate the wrist, assessing for tenderness, warmth, and swelling. Check for any bony abnormalities or crepitus.</li>
            <li>Assess the range of motion of the wrist, including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Ask the patient to move their wrist in each direction, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
            <li>Perform specific tests to assess for specific injuries or conditions, such as the Finkelstein's test for De Quervain's tenosynovitis, or the Tinel's sign for carpal tunnel syndrome.</li>
            <li>Perform a neurovascular examination, assessing for any signs of nerve or blood vessel injury. Test the patient's sensation and reflexes, as well as their pulse and blood pressure in the affected hand or fingers.</li>
            <li>Assess for any signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, such as tingling or numbness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers. This may be done using the Phalen's test, Tinel's sign, or other diagnostic maneuvers.</li>
            <li>Check for any deformities or abnormalities in the wrist or hand, such as swelling, bruising, or discoloration. Assess for any signs of arthritis, tendonitis, or other inflammatory conditions.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the range of motion of the wrist and fingers, including flexion, extension, and rotation. Ask the patient to make a fist, touch their fingers to their palm, and spread their fingers apart, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
            <li>Perform any additional tests or maneuvers as indicated by the patient's symptoms or medical history. This may include provocative testing for specific conditions, such as De Quervain's tenosynovitis or trigger finger.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Imaging studies, such as X-rays or MRI, may be ordered if the examination reveals any abnormalities or if further evaluation is needed.</p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>A knee examination is performed in the emergency department to evaluate any injuries or abnormalities in the knee joint. The examination is typically done on patients who have sustained a knee injury or are experiencing knee pain, and is important for identifying potential ligament, tendon, or cartilage injuries.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
        <p>The knee examination involves the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Inspect the knee for any obvious abnormalities, such as swelling, bruising, or lacerations. Check for any penetrating injuries or foreign objects that may have entered the knee.</li>
            <li>Palpate the knee, assessing for tenderness, warmth, and swelling. Check for any bony abnormalities or crepitus.</li>
            <li>Assess the range of motion of the knee, including flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Ask the patient to move their knee in each direction, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
            <li>Perform specific tests to assess for specific injuries or conditions, such as the Lachman test for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries or the McMurray test for meniscus tears.</li>
            <li>Perform a neurovascular examination, assessing for any signs of nerve or blood vessel injury. Test the patient's sensation and reflexes in the affected limb.</li>
            <li>Assess the patient's gait by observing their walking pattern, looking for any abnormalities or limping. Ask the patient to perform heel-to-toe walking, tandem walking, and squatting to evaluate their balance and coordination.</li>
            <li>Assess the stability of the knee joint by performing tests such as the Lachman test, pivot shift test, and anterior drawer test. These tests can help identify any ligamentous injuries, such as an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear.</li>
            <li>Assess the range of motion of the knee, including flexion and extension. Observe for any limitations or pain during movement.</li>
            <li>Palpate the knee joint, checking for any tenderness, swelling, or bony deformities. Pay particular attention to the medial and lateral joint lines, the patellar tendon, and the collateral ligaments.</li>
            <li>Perform additional tests as necessary based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, such as the McMurray test for meniscal injuries or the Thessaly test for meniscal and collateral ligament injuries.</li>
            </ol>

                        <p>The diagnosis of knee injuries and conditions is usually made based on a combination of a physical examination, medical history, imaging studies, and laboratory tests.

                        <h2 class="subheading">Treatment</h2>
                        <p>The treatment of knee injuries and conditions depends on the severity of the injury, the underlying cause, and the patient's symptoms. Treatment options may include:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Rest:</strong> Resting the affected knee and avoiding activities that may aggravate the injury</li>
                          <li><strong>Ice:</strong> Applying ice packs to the knee to reduce swelling and pain</li>
                          <li><strong>Compression:</strong> Wearing a compression bandage or knee brace to support the knee and reduce swelling</li>
                          <li><strong>Elevation:</strong> Elevating the affected leg to reduce swelling and improve circulation</li>
                          <li><strong>Medications:</strong> Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroid injections may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and pain</li>
                          <li><strong>Physical therapy:</strong> Performing exercises to improve knee strength, flexibility, and range of motion and promote healing</li>
                          <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair fractures, tears, or other damage to the knee joint</li>

                        <ul>
                          <li>Wearing proper footwear and protective gear during physical activity</li>
                          <li>Using proper technique when performing activities that involve the knees, such as running, jumping, or lifting weights</li>
                          <li>Taking frequent breaks during activities that involve prolonged knee use</li>
                          <li>Performing stretching and strengthening exercises to improve knee joint flexibility and strength</li>
                          <li>Using assistive devices such as braces, crutches, or walkers to support the knee and reduce stress on the joint</li>
                          <li>Taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to manage pain and inflammation</li>
                          <li>Prescribing stronger pain medications or corticosteroid injections for more severe pain or inflammation</li>
                          <li>Referring patients to physical therapy for supervised exercise programs or other treatments such as ultrasound therapy or electrical stimulation</li>
                          <li>Performing surgical procedures such as arthroscopy, osteotomy, or knee replacement in severe cases of knee injuries or degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis</li>

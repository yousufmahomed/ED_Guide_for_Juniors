    <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>An elbow examination is a physical examination used to assess the function and condition of the elbow joint. It can help identify various conditions or injuries, including fractures, dislocations, and arthritis.</p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
    <p>The elbow examination involves the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inspection: Inspect the elbow for any swelling, redness, deformity, or skin changes. Note any visible abnormalities or injuries.</li>
        <li>Palpation: Palpate the elbow joint and surrounding tissues, noting any areas of tenderness, swelling, or warmth. Check for the presence of any fluid collection or masses.</li>
        <li>Range of motion: Assess the elbow's range of motion by asking the patient to bend and straighten the arm, as well as to rotate the forearm. Note any limitations or pain.</li>
        <li>Strength: Test the strength of the patient's elbow by asking them to flex and extend their arm against resistance, as well as to grip and release objects.</li>
        <li>Neurovascular examination: Perform a neurovascular examination of the arm, checking for any signs of nerve or blood vessel injury. Test the patient's sensation and reflexes, as well as their pulse and blood pressure in the affected arm.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2 class="subheading">Indications for Imaging Studies</h2>
    <p>Imaging studies may be indicated for the following patients:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Indication</th>
        <th>Imaging Study</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Suspected fracture</td>
        <td>X-ray</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Suspected dislocation</td>
        <td>X-ray</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Suspected ligament or tendon injury</td>
        <td>MRI</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Chronic pain or instability</td>
        <td>CT scan or MRI</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="subheading">Management of Elbow Injuries</h2>
    <p>The management of elbow injuries depends on the severity and location of the injury. In general, management strategies may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rest and ice: Resting the affected arm and applying ice to the area can help reduce pain and swelling</li>
      <li>Pain management: Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, or muscle relaxants may be used to manage pain</li>
      <li>Physical therapy: Once the injury has stabilized, physical therapy may be recommended to improve range of motion and strength</li>
      <li>Surgery: Surgery may be necessary in some cases, such as for fractures, dislocations, or severe ligament or tendon injuries</li>
      <li>Bracing or casting: Bracing or casting may be used to immobilize the elbow and promote healing</li>
      <li>Monitoring: Regular monitoring and imaging may be necessary to ensure that the injury is healing properly and to detect any complications</li>
    </ul>

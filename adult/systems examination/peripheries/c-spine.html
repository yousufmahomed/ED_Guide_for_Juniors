    <h2 class="subheading">Introduction</h2>
    <p>A cervical spine examination is performed in the emergency department to assess for any injuries or abnormalities in the neck and spinal cord. This examination is typically done on patients who have been involved in a traumatic event or have neck pain, and is essential for identifying any potential spinal cord injuries.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
    <p>The cervical spine examination involves the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inspect the neck for any obvious abnormalities or deformities, such as swelling, bruising, or lacerations. Check for any penetrating injuries or foreign objects that may have entered the neck.</li>
        <li>Palpate the cervical spine, assessing for tenderness, muscle spasm, and bony abnormalities. Apply gentle pressure to the spinous processes of each vertebra, checking for any pain or discomfort.</li>
        <li>Assess the range of motion of the cervical spine, including flexion, extension, rotation, and lateral bending. Ask the patient to move their head in each direction, observing for any limitations or pain.</li>
        <li>Perform a neurologic examination, assessing for any motor or sensory deficits, reflexes, and signs of spinal cord injury. Check for any weakness or loss of sensation in the arms or legs, abnormal reflexes, or bowel or bladder dysfunction.</li>
        <li>Consider imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans, to further evaluate any suspected injuries or abnormalities. Imaging may be particularly important in patients with suspected spinal cord injury or those who are unable to move their neck due to pain or spasm.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It's worth noting that in cases of suspected cervical spine injury, it's important to immobilize the neck using a cervical collar or other device to prevent further damage until imaging studies can be performed.</p> 
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="subheading">Indications for Imaging Studies</h2>
    <p>Imaging studies may be indicated for the following patients:</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Indication</th>
        <th>Imaging Study</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>High-risk mechanism of injury</td>
        <td>Cervical spine X-rays, CT scan</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Neurologic symptoms or deficits</td>
        <td>Cervical spine X-rays, CT scan, MRI</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Age &gt;65 years old</td>
        <td>Cervical spine X-rays, CT scan</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Intoxication or altered mental status</td>
        <td>Cervical spine X-rays, CT scan</td>
      </tr>

  <div class="section">
    <h2 class="subheading">Management of Cervical Spine Injuries</h2>
    <p>The management of cervical spine injuries depends on the severity and location of the injury. In general, management strategies may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Immobilization: Immobilization of the cervical spine using a cervical collar, backboard, or other devices to prevent further injury</li>
      <li>Pain management: Medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, or muscle relaxants may be used to manage pain</li>
      <li>Surgery: Surgery may be necessary in some cases, such as for spinal cord compression or instability</li>
      <li>Physical therapy: Once the injury has stabilized, physical therapy may be recommended to improve range of motion and strength</li>
      <li>Monitoring: Regular monitoring and imaging may be necessary to ensure that the injury is healing properly and to detect any complications</li>
    </ul>

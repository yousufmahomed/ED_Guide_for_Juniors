    <!-- Overview -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The cervical spine examination in the Emergency Department focuses on identifying
        clinically important cervical spine injuries and spinal cord compromise following trauma,
        as well as non-traumatic pathology such as infection, malignancy and degenerative disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key principle is that <span class="key-point">you should not move the neck or test range of motion
        until it has been clinically cleared or adequately imaged</span>. Maintain spinal precautions in
        any patient with suspected cervical injury.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Initial priorities & red flags -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Initial Priorities & Red Flags</h2>
      <p>After primary survey (ABC), identify the following red flags:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="red-flag">High-risk mechanism:</span> high-speed RTC, axial load (diving), fall from height, ejection from vehicle, pedestrian vs vehicle.</li>
        <li><span class="red-flag">Neurological deficit:</span> weakness, paraesthesia, sensory level, sphincter disturbance, priapism after trauma.</li>
        <li><span class="red-flag">Midline cervical tenderness</span> on palpation.</li>
        <li><span class="red-flag">Altered mental status:</span> GCS &lt;15, confusion, agitation, intoxication.</li>
        <li><span class="red-flag">Distracting injuries:</span> major limb fractures, thoracoabdominal trauma, severe facial injuries.</li>
        <li><span class="red-flag">Signs of spinal cord injury:</span> hypotension with bradycardia (neurogenic shock), flaccid weakness, sensory loss, abnormal reflexes.</li>
        <li><span class="red-flag">Non-traumatic red flags:</span> fever, weight loss, known malignancy, severe night pain, immunosuppression, IV drug use, inflammatory arthritis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="key-point">
        If any red flag is present, maintain full spinal immobilisation and obtain urgent senior and
        orthopaedic/neurosurgical input.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Focused history -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Focused History</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mechanism of injury:</strong> exact mechanism, speed, height, direct blow vs axial load, associated head injury or loss of consciousness.</li>
        <li><strong>Onset of symptoms:</strong> immediate vs delayed neck pain, any initial paraesthesia or weakness.</li>
        <li><strong>Neurological symptoms:</strong> limb weakness, numbness, tingling, gait disturbance, bowel or bladder dysfunction.</li>
        <li><strong>Pain features:</strong> location (midline vs paraspinal), severity, radiation to shoulders or arms.</li>
        <li><strong>Associated injuries:</strong> head, facial, chest, abdominal or limb injuries that may distract from neck pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Non-traumatic context:</strong> fevers, weight loss, known cancer, RA, ankylosing spondylitis, IV drug use.</li>
        <li><strong>Medications & background:</strong> anticoagulants/antiplatelets, osteoporosis, previous cervical surgery or known cervical disease.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Clinical decision rules -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Cervical Spine Clearance (Clinical Decision Rules)</h2>
      <p>
        In alert, stable adults, validated decision rules (e.g. NEXUS, Canadian C-Spine Rule) help
        determine whether imaging is required. Local protocols may vary; always follow your hospital
        guideline.
      </p>
      <p><span class="key-point">In general, imaging is usually required if any of the following apply:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Midline cervical tenderness.</li>
        <li>Focal neurological deficit.</li>
        <li>Altered level of consciousness or intoxication.</li>
        <li>Painful distracting injury.</li>
        <li>High-risk mechanism or age &ge;65 years (depending on the rule used).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only when the cervical spine is clinically cleared using a validated rule and the patient
        demonstrates full, painless active range of motion is it safe to remove spinal precautions
        without imaging (per local policy).
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Examination technique -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Examination Technique</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="key-point">Important:</span> In any patient with suspected cervical spine injury,
        maintain in-line stabilisation and do <strong>not</strong> assess active range of motion until the
        neck is cleared clinically or radiologically.
      </p>

      <h3 class="subheading-small">1. Look</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Inspect for deformity, step-off, bruising, wounds, or swelling along the neck.</li>
        <li>Note position of the head and neck, use of cervical collar, and presence of any torticollis.</li>
        <li>Look for associated head/facial injuries and signs of trauma to the shoulders or thorax.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subheading-small">2. Feel</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>With in-line stabilisation, palpate the <strong>spinous processes</strong> from the occiput to T1 for midline tenderness or step deformities.</li>
        <li>Palpate paraspinal muscles for spasm or tenderness.</li>
        <li>Do not force movement; keep the neck in neutral alignment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subheading-small">3. Neurological Examination</h3>
      <p>Perform and document a focused neurological exam of all four limbs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Motor:</strong> test power in key myotomes (shoulder abduction, elbow flexion/extension, wrist extension, finger abduction, hip and knee movements, ankle dorsiflexion/plantarflexion).</li>
        <li><strong>Sensation:</strong> assess light touch and pinprick in dermatomal distribution from C2–S1.</li>
        <li><strong>Reflexes:</strong> biceps, brachioradialis, triceps, knee and ankle jerks; note hyperreflexia or clonus.</li>
        <li><strong>Upper motor neuron signs:</strong> Babinski, Hoffman’s sign, tone and coordination if spinal cord injury suspected.</li>
        <li><strong>Sphincter function:</strong> ask about urinary retention, incontinence, or loss of anal tone in severe or high lesions (usually with senior involvement).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="subheading-small">4. Range of Motion (Only When Safe)</h3>
      <p>
        Assess active range of motion <strong>only if the cervical spine has been cleared</strong> by decision rules or
        imaging, and the patient has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No midline tenderness.</li>
        <li>No neurological deficits.</li>
        <li>No intoxication or distracting injuries.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then ask the patient to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Flex and extend the neck (“chin to chest”, “look at the ceiling”).</li>
        <li>Rotate to left and right (usually &ge;45° to each side if using Canadian C-Spine criteria).</li>
        <li>Laterally tilt ears towards shoulders.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Stop if any movement causes severe pain, dizziness, or new neurological symptoms.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Imaging indications -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Indications for Imaging Studies</h2>
      <p>
        CT has largely replaced plain X-rays for cervical spine assessment in many centres, particularly
        for moderate-to-high risk trauma. Follow your local imaging protocol.
      </p>
      <table class="responsive-table">
        <thead>
          <tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Non-traumatic red flags (infection, malignancy, inflammatory disease)</td>
            <td>
              MRI cervical spine (often after initial plain films or CT), guided by specialist advice.

    <!-- Management -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Management of Cervical Spine Injuries</h2>
      <p>
        Management depends on the nature and severity of injury, but several ED principles apply:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Immobilisation:</strong> maintain in-line stabilisation and appropriate spinal precautions (collar, blocks, tape or vacuum mattress) until the cervical spine is cleared.</li>
        <li><strong>Pain management:</strong> multimodal analgesia (paracetamol, NSAIDs if appropriate, opioids), muscle relaxants when safe and after serious injury is excluded.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuroprotection:</strong> maintain adequate blood pressure and oxygenation; avoid hypotension and hypoxia, which worsen spinal cord outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Surgical management:</strong> unstable fractures, dislocations, cord compression or progressive neurology require urgent orthopaedic/neurosurgical review and often surgical stabilisation or decompression.</li>
        <li><strong>Conservative management:</strong> stable fractures or soft tissue injuries may be managed with collars, analgesia and outpatient follow-up, as guided by specialists.</li>
        <li><strong>Rehabilitation:</strong> early involvement of physiotherapy and rehabilitation teams is crucial once the injury is stabilised.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Patient advice -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="subheading">Patient Advice & Follow-Up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Explain the diagnosis (or lack of structural injury if cleared) and expected recovery.</li>
        <li>Provide advice on collar use where appropriate, and gentle mobilisation exercises if safe.</li>
        <li>Give clear return precautions: increasing neck pain, new weakness, numbness, gait disturbance, or bladder/bowel symptoms.</li>
        <li>Arrange follow-up with orthopaedics, neurosurgery or primary care as indicated by imaging and clinical findings.</li>

		<p>Perform a thorough exam of the eyes and vision, including:</p>

            <h2 class="subheading">Visual Acuity</h2>
            <p>Check the patient's visual acuity using an eye chart or other tool. Record the results in both eyes separately.</p>
            <p>Visual acuity is a measure of the patient's ability to see objects clearly at a distance. The most commonly used tool for measuring visual acuity is the Snellen chart, which consists of letters or symbols of various sizes. The patient stands a certain distance away from the chart and reads the letters or symbols from smallest to largest. The smallest letters or symbols that the patient can read accurately indicate their visual acuity.</p>
            <p>The results are recorded as a fraction, with the numerator representing the distance from the chart at which the patient is standing (usually 6 meters), and the denominator representing the smallest line of letters or symbols that the patient can read accurately. For example, if a patient can read the line of letters labeled "20/40" at a distance of 6 meters, their visual acuity would be recorded as "20/40" for that eye.</p>
            <p>Visual acuity is measured separately in each eye, as the results can vary between eyes. A patient may have different visual acuity in each eye due to conditions such as amblyopia (lazy eye), cataracts, or other factors.</p>

		<h2 class="subheading">External Eye Exam</h2>
		<p>Perform an external exam of the eyes, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Redness, swelling, or discharge: These can be symptoms of a variety of conditions, including infections or inflammation.</li>
			<li>Abnormalities in eyelid position or movement: These can be a sign of nerve damage or other conditions affecting the muscles or nerves controlling the eyelids.</li>
			<li>Lumps or bumps: These can be a sign of a variety of conditions, including cysts, tumors, or styes.</li>
			<li>Foreign bodies: These can include objects that are stuck in the eye, such as dirt, sand, or metal shards. Foreign bodies can cause irritation, inflammation, or infection in the eye.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="subheading">Internal Eye Exam</h2>
		<p>Perform an internal exam of the eyes using an ophthalmoscope, including:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Pupillary response: Check the size and reaction of the pupils to light. Abnormalities in pupillary response can be a sign of nerve damage or other conditions affecting the pupils.</li>
			<li>Lens clarity: Check the clarity of the lens in each eye. Cloudiness or other abnormalities can be a sign of cataracts or other conditions.</li>
			<li>Retina and optic nerve: Examine the retina and optic nerve using an ophthalmoscope. Look for abnormalities such as hemorrhages, exudates, or optic disc cupping.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="subheading">Intraocular Pressure</h2>
		<p>Check the patient's intraocular pressure using a tonometer. High intraocular pressure can be a sign of glaucoma, while low intraocular pressure can be a sign of other conditions.</p>

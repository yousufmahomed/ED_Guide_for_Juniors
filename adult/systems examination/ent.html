		<h2 class="subheading">Patient History</h2>
		<p>Start by asking the patient about their symptoms, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ear pain: This can be a symptom of an ear infection, injury, or other conditions affecting the ear.</li>
            <li>Loss of hearing: This can be a gradual or sudden decrease in hearing ability, and can be a sign of a variety of conditions, including infections, earwax buildup, or hearing loss due to aging.</li>
            <li>Tinnitus (ringing in the ears): This is a sensation of ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in the ears, and can be a symptom of a variety of conditions, including ear infections, exposure to loud noise, or certain medications.</li>
            <li>Vertigo (dizziness): This is a sensation of spinning or dizziness, and can be a symptom of a variety of conditions affecting the ear or the brain.</li>
            <li>Nasal congestion: This can be a symptom of a sinus infection, allergies, or other conditions affecting the nose and sinuses.</li>
            <li>Difficulty swallowing: This can be a symptom of a variety of conditions affecting the throat or esophagus, including infections, inflammation, or tumors.</li>
            <li>Sore throat: This can be a symptom of a variety of conditions, including infections, allergies, or acid reflux.</li>
            <li>History of ear or sinus infections: Patients who have a history of ear or sinus infections may be more prone to these conditions in the future, and may require more frequent monitoring or treatment.</li>
            <li>Recent trauma to the head or neck: Recent trauma can cause a variety of symptoms affecting the ears, nose, and throat, and may require immediate medical attention.</li>
        </ul>

		<h2 class="subheading">Physical Exam</h2>
		<p>Perform a thorough physical exam of the ears, nose, and throat, including:</p>
		<strong>Ears</strong>
		<p>Use an otoscope to examine the ear canal and tympanic membrane (eardrum). Look for:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Redness, swelling, or discharge: These may indicate an infection or inflammation in the ear. Redness and swelling may also be a sign of trauma to the ear. Discharge can be a symptom of a ruptured eardrum or an ear infection.</li>
            <li>Tearing or perforation of the eardrum: A ruptured eardrum can cause hearing loss and may require medical treatment.</li>
            <li>Foreign bodies (such as earwax or insects): These can cause irritation, pain, or hearing loss and may need to be removed by a healthcare professional.</li>
            <li>Signs of infection or inflammation: These may include redness, warmth, tenderness, and pain in the ear. The ear may also produce pus or other discharge.</li>
            <li>Abnormalities in hearing: Conduct a hearing test to check for any hearing loss or abnormalities in hearing. This may involve a whisper test or tuning fork test.</li>
        </ul>

		<strong>Nose</strong>
		<p>Examine the nasal passages for:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Signs of obstruction or congestion: These may indicate a blockage in the nasal passages, which can cause difficulty breathing, snoring, or sleep apnea.</li>
            <li>Discharge or bleeding: These can be symptoms of a sinus infection, allergies, or other conditions.</li>
            <li>Deviated septum or other abnormalities: A deviated septum is a common condition in which the nasal septum (the wall that separates the two nostrils) is shifted to one side, making it difficult to breathe through one or both nostrils. Other abnormalities may include nasal polyps, tumors, or cysts.</li>
            <li>Foreign bodies: These can include objects that are stuck in the nose, such as small toys or food particles. Foreign bodies can cause irritation, inflammation, or infection in the nasal passages.</li>
        </ul>

		<strong>Throat</strong>
		<p>Examine the mouth and throat using a tongue depressor and flashlight. Look for:</p>
		<ul>
            <li>Redness, swelling, or discharge: These may indicate an infection or inflammation in the throat. Redness and swelling may also be a sign of trauma to the throat. Discharge can be a symptom of a throat infection.</li>
            <li>Tonsillitis or pharyngitis: Tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils, while pharyngitis is inflammation of the pharynx (the back of the throat). These conditions can cause sore throat, difficulty swallowing, fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck.</li>
            <li>Ulcers or lesions: These may indicate a viral infection, such as herpes simplex virus (cold sores) or Epstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis). They can also be a sign of oral cancer or other conditions.</li>
            <li>Foreign bodies: These can include objects that are stuck in the throat, such as fish bones or pills. Foreign bodies can cause irritation, inflammation, or infection in the throat.</li>
            <li>Difficulty swallowing: This can be a symptom of a variety of conditions, including throat infections, acid reflux, or neurological disorders.</li>
            <li>Enlarged lymph nodes: These may indicate an infection or inflammation in the throat, or may be a sign of a more serious condition such as lymphoma.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="subheading">Diagnostic Tests</h2>
        <p>Depending on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, diagnostic tests may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audiometry: A hearing test that measures the patient's ability to hear sounds at different frequencies and volumes.</li>
            <li>Computed tomography (CT) scan: An imaging test that can provide detailed images of the ears, nose, and throat to help diagnose conditions such as sinusitis, tumors, or fractures.</li>
            <li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): An imaging test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce detailed images of the head and neck. It can help diagnose conditions such as tumors, infections, or nerve damage.</li>
            <li>Endoscopy: A procedure in which a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end is inserted into the nose or throat to examine the nasal passages, sinuses, or larynx (voice box).</li>
            <li>Swab culture: A test in which a sample of discharge from the ear, nose, or throat is collected and analyzed in a lab to determine the presence of bacteria, viruses, or fungi.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="subheading">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Obstetric assessment in the Emergency Department focuses on the safety of both mother and fetus.
        Time-critical conditions include ectopic pregnancy, placental abruption, placenta praevia, severe
        pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, preterm labour, ruptured membranes, uterine rupture and maternal trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
        The approach combines ABC stabilisation, rapid obstetric history, focussed examination, fetal
        assessment and early consultation with OBGYN according to local protocols.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gestation and obstetric history:</strong> gravidity, parity, LMP/EDD, multiple pregnancy, previous caesarean, prior complications (e.g. pre-eclampsia, haemorrhage, ectopic, IUFD).</li>
        <li><strong>Presenting complaint:</strong> abdominal pain, PV bleeding, reduced fetal movements, contractions, leaking fluid, headache, visual changes, dyspnoea or chest pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Bleeding:</strong> onset, amount, clots, associated pain, relation to trauma or intercourse.</li>
        <li><strong>Fluid loss:</strong> gush vs trickle, colour (clear, bloodstained, meconium), odour, time of onset.</li>
        <li><strong>Fetal movements:</strong> normal, reduced or absent; time since last felt.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical history:</strong> hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, epilepsy, HIV, renal disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Medication and allergies:</strong> antihypertensives, anticoagulants, antiepileptics, ART, supplements.</li>

        <span class="key-point">Red flags:</span> severe or sudden abdominal pain, heavy PV bleeding, reduced/absent fetal movements,

      <h2 class="subheading">Obstetric Assessment</h2>
      <p>During obstetric assessment in the Emergency Department, clinicians will typically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Take a thorough obstetric and medical history, including pregnancy details, prenatal care and complications.
          This may include due date, number of previous pregnancies and deliveries, prior complications, and current
          medications or supplements. Click to open the

          </a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Perform a focused physical examination, including abdominal examination (fundal height, lie, presentation,
          engagement, tenderness, contractions) and, when indicated and safe, a pelvic examination to assess cervical
          dilation/effacement and PV bleeding or fluid.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Fetal heart rate monitoring helps assess fetal wellbeing;
          contraction pattern helps determine labour status.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assess for signs of preterm labour (contractions, cervical change, ruptured membranes) and term labour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check maternal vital signs: blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          Order diagnostic tests such as blood work, urine tests and ultrasound imaging as needed to assess maternal
          and fetal status and identify complications.
        </li>
        <li>
          Determine gestational age and estimate fetal weight to guide management decisions, where possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assess for signs of fetal compromise or serious complications such as placental abruption, placenta praevia,
          uterine rupture or eclampsia, and escalate urgently where indicated.
        </li>

      <h2 class="subheading">Management of Eclampsia</h2>
      <p>
        Eclampsia is the occurrence of seizures in a patient with pre-eclampsia and is an obstetric emergency.
        Priorities are maternal stabilisation, seizure control, blood pressure management and planning for delivery.
        Always follow your local OBGYN protocols for exact dosing and indications.

              Magnesium sulphate is first-line to control seizures and prevent recurrence. Benzodiazepines may be used

      <h2 class="subheading">Maternal Trauma & ED Caesarean Section</h2>
      <p>
        Maternal trauma can result from motor vehicle collisions, falls, assault or other mechanisms. Management
        follows standard trauma principles with modifications for pregnancy (left lateral tilt, attention to uterine
        displacement, and fetal assessment where possible).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Emergency Department, priorities include rapid assessment of maternal vital signs, primary and secondary
        survey, appropriate imaging (balancing maternal benefit and fetal risk), and continuous fetal monitoring when
        feasible. Rh-negative mothers may require anti-D as per protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        In rare situations, an emergency caesarean section may be required in the ED to save the mother and/or fetus.
        Indications for perimortem/ED caesarean section include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maternal cardiac arrest (particularly ≥ 20–24 weeks gestation) where resuscitation is ongoing.</li>
        <li>Maternal instability with inability to resuscitate adequately due to gravid uterus.</li>
        <li>Severe maternal trauma with fetal compromise and no time for theatre transfer.</li>
        <li>Catastrophic obstetric events such as uterine rupture or massive placental abruption with fetal compromise.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ED caesarean is a last resort, performed only in extreme emergencies by trained staff, with immediate
        involvement of OBGYN, anaesthesia and neonatal teams where available. Close monitoring for haemorrhage,
        infection and other complications is required post-delivery.

    <h2 class="subheading">Obstetric Assessment</h2>
    <p>During obstetric assessment in the emergency department, providers will typically perform the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take a thorough medical history, including information about the patient's pregnancy, prenatal care, and any complications. This may include asking about the patient's due date, the number of previous pregnancies, any prior complications, and any medications or supplements the patient is taking.

        <li>Perform a physical examination, including a pelvic exam and abdominal exam. The pelvic exam may assess cervical dilation and effacement, as well as the position of the fetus. The abdominal exam may assess fundal height and the presence of fetal movements.</li>
        <li>Monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. Fetal heart rate monitoring can help assess the health of the fetus, while uterine contractions can help determine if the patient is in labor.</li>
        <li>Assess for signs of preterm labor, including cervical dilation and effacement. Preterm labor can be a serious complication that may require prompt intervention to prevent preterm birth and potential complications for the baby.</li>
        <li>Check the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels. Vital sign monitoring can help assess the patient's overall health and identify any potential complications.</li>
        <li>Order diagnostic tests, such as blood work, urine tests, and ultrasound imaging, as needed. These tests can help assess the health of the mother and fetus and identify any potential complications.</li>
        <li>Determine the patient's gestational age and estimate the fetal weight. This information can help guide management decisions and assess the health of the fetus.</li>
        <li>Assess for signs of fetal distress or other complications, such as placental abruption or uterine rupture. Fetal distress can be a serious complication that may require immediate intervention, while placental abruption and uterine rupture are rare but potentially life-threatening emergencies.</li>
      </ul>

            <h2 class="subheading">Maternal Trauma and ED Caesarian Section</h2>
            <p>Maternal trauma can occur as a result of a variety of causes, including motor vehicle accidents, falls, and physical assault. In the emergency department, the patient's vital signs are immediately assessed, and a thorough physical examination is performed to assess for injuries. Diagnostic tests, such as X-rays and CT scans, may be ordered to evaluate for internal injuries.</p>
            <p>In cases of severe maternal trauma, an emergency caesarian section may be necessary to deliver the baby quickly and avoid further harm to the mother and child. This procedure involves making an incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus to deliver the baby. Indications for an ED caesarian section include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maternal instability or cardiac arrest</li>
              <li>Fetal distress or compromise</li>
              <li>Complete placenta previa with heavy bleeding</li>
              <li>Uterine rupture or abruption</li>
              <li>Maternal trauma with fetal compromise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ED caesarian sections are considered a last resort and are only performed in emergent situations where waiting for a scheduled procedure is not feasible. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia, and the mother and baby are closely monitored for complications, such as bleeding and infection, following the delivery.</p>

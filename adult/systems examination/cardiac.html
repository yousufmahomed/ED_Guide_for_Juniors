			<li>Current medications</li>
			<li>Smoking history</li>
			<li>Exercise habits</li>
			<li>Other medical conditions</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="subheading">Vital Signs</h2>
		<p>The following vital signs should be measured:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Blood pressure</li>
			<li>Heart rate</li>
			<li>Respiratory rate</li>
			<li>Temperature</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Abnormal vital signs may indicate a cardiac problem and should be carefully monitored.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="subheading">Physical Examination</h2>
		<p>The following physical examinations should be performed:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Inspection: Observe the chest for any abnormalities, such as a visible apical impulse, or heaves and lifts.</li>
			<li>Palpation: Assess for any areas of tenderness, palpable thrills or heaves, or pulsations. Palpate the carotid arteries, assess for JVP, palpate the precordium, and assess for a point of maximal impulse.</li>
            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="subheading">Palpation During a Cardiac Examination</h2>
                <p>Palpation is an important component of the cardiac examination that involves feeling different areas of the chest and neck for any abnormalities or indications of heart function. During palpation, healthcare providers assess for areas of tenderness, palpable thrills or heaves, and pulsations.</p>
                <p>Here are the key areas that healthcare providers typically palpate during a cardiac examination:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Carotid arteries:</strong> Healthcare providers palpate the carotid arteries on either side of the neck to assess for any abnormalities, such as carotid artery stenosis or bruits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jugular venous pulse (JVP):</strong> The JVP is assessed by feeling for pulsations in the jugular veins in the neck. It is used to assess right atrial pressure and can indicate heart failure or other cardiac conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Precordium:</strong> The precordium is the area of the chest overlying the heart. Healthcare providers palpate the precordium to assess for any areas of tenderness, thrills, or heaves. A thrill is a vibration felt on the chest wall that indicates turbulent blood flow, while a heave is a visible pulsation of the chest wall that indicates increased force of cardiac contraction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Point of maximal impulse (PMI):</strong> The PMI is the point on the chest where the apex of the heart touches the chest wall. Healthcare providers palpate the PMI to assess for any abnormalities, such as a displaced or enlarged PMI.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Common findings and abnormalities detected during palpation during a cardiac examination include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pulsations or thrills: These may indicate heart murmurs or other abnormalities in blood flow.</li>
                    <li>Tenderness or pain: These may indicate inflammation or other cardiac conditions.</li>
                    <li>Jugular venous distention: This may indicate right-sided heart failure or other cardiac conditions.</li>
                    <li>Enlarged or displaced PMI: This may indicate an enlarged heart or other cardiac conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
			<li>Auscultation: Listen for heart sounds, including S1, S2, and any murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Use the bell and diaphragm of the stethoscope to assess for high-pitched and low-pitched sounds.</li>
            <div class="section">
                <h2 class="subheading">Auscultation of the Heart</h2>
                <p>Auscultation of the heart is a critical component of the cardiac examination. By listening to the sounds produced by the heart, healthcare providers can detect a wide range of abnormalities and conditions. During the auscultation process, the healthcare provider listens for heart sounds using a stethoscope, which consists of a bell and a diaphragm.</p>
                <p>The bell is used to detect low-pitched sounds, while the diaphragm is used to detect high-pitched sounds. Healthcare providers typically listen for four primary sounds: S1, S2, S3, and S4.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>S1:</strong> The first heart sound and is caused by the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves. It is typically a low-pitched sound that occurs at the beginning of systole.</li>
                    <li><strong>S2:</strong> The second heart sound and is caused by the closure of the aortic and pulmonic valves. It is typically a higher-pitched sound than S1 and occurs at the end of systole.</li>
                    <li><strong>S3:</strong> A low-pitched sound that occurs early in diastole and is associated with rapid filling of the ventricles. S3 can be a normal finding in children and young adults but may indicate heart failure in older patients.</li>
                    <li><strong>S4:</strong> A low-pitched sound that occurs late in diastole and is associated with atrial contraction. S4 is often a sign of a stiff or noncompliant ventricle and may indicate coronary artery disease or hypertension.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition to these four primary sounds, healthcare providers listen for murmurs, rubs, and gallops during auscultation. Murmurs are caused by turbulent blood flow and may indicate valve abnormalities or other cardiac conditions. Rubs are caused by inflammation of the pericardium and may indicate pericarditis. Gallops are additional heart sounds that may indicate heart failure or other cardiac conditions.</p>
                <p>Common findings and abnormalities detected during auscultation of the heart include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Murmurs: These may indicate valve abnormalities, such as stenosis, regurgitation, or prolapse. They can also be caused by congenital heart defects, endocarditis, or other cardiac conditions.</li>
                    <li>Extra heart sounds (S3 and S4): These may indicate heart failure, hypertension, or coronary artery disease.</li>
                    <li>Tachycardia: This is a heart rate that is faster than normal and may indicate an underlying cardiac condition or other medical problem.</li>
                    <li>Bradycardia: This is a heart rate that is slower than normal and may indicate an underlying cardiac condition or other medical problem.</li>
                    <li>Irregular heart rhythm: This may indicate arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia.</li>
                    <li>Rubs: These may indicate pericarditis, a condition in which the sac surrounding the heart becomes inflamed.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
			<li>Percussion: Not typically used in a cardiac examination.</li>
        </ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="subheading">Diagnostic Tests</h2>
		<p>Depending on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, diagnostic tests may include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Electrocardiogram (ECG): Measures the electrical activity of the heart and can detect any arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, or evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction.</li>
			<li>Echocardiogram: Uses ultrasound waves to create an image of the heart and its structures. Can evaluate the size and function of the heart, the presence of valve abnormalities, and the presence of pericardial effusion.</li>
			<li>Cardiac stress test: Measures the heart's response to exercise or pharmacological stress. Can detect evidence of ischemia or other abnormalities in heart function.</li>
			<li>Cardiac catheterization: Invasive test that involves inserting a catheter into the heart and injecting contrast dye to evaluate the coronary arteries and the function of the heart.</li>
			<li>Blood tests: Can detect elevated levels of cardiac enzymes, which may indicate damage to the heart muscle.</li>
			<li>Chest X-ray: Can evaluate the size and shape of the heart and detect any evidence of pulmonary congestion or fluid accumulation in the lungs.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="section">
		<h2 class="subheading">Summary</h2>
		<p>A cardiac examination is an important tool for evaluating the function and health of the heart. By taking a thorough patient history, performing a physical exam, and conducting appropriate diagnostic tests, healthcare providers can diagnose and manage a wide range of cardiac conditions.</p>

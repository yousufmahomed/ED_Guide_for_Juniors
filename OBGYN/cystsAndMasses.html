    <h2 class="strong">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Ovarian cysts and masses are common gynecologic conditions that can occur at any stage of life. Most are benign and resolve without intervention, but some may be malignant or associated with complications.
    </p>

    <h2 class="strong">Types of Cysts and Masses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple follicular cysts arise from failed follicle rupture and are typically thin-walled and filled with clear fluid.</li>
      <li>Corpus luteal cysts may contain hemorrhagic fluid and can be associated with pain and rupture.</li>
      <li>Other types include endometriomas, benign cystic teratomas, cystadenomas, fibromas, and malignant neoplasms.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="strong">Clinical Presentation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pelvic pain is the most common symptom, with different cyst types causing varying degrees of pain.</li>
      <li>Rupture of cysts can lead to sudden pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and hemorrhage.</li>
      <li>Some cysts may be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during routine pelvic examinations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Differential Diagnoses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Urgent conditions causing pelvic pain, such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and urinary tract infections, should be considered.</li>
      <li>Gastrointestinal conditions and tumors can mimic adnexal masses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Diagnostic Evaluation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Exclude pregnancy with urine or serum Î²-hCG test.</li>
      <li>Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality, differentiating between various cyst types and detecting associated complications.</li>
      <li>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used in atypical presentations or to rule out alternative diagnoses.</li>
      <li>Hematocrit may help assess blood loss in cases of cyst rupture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Management and Disposition</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Most uncomplicated simple cysts will resolve without intervention; manage pain with NSAIDs and provide follow-up for resolution.</li>
      <li>Complex cysts concerning for malignancy require gynecologic consultation.</li>
      <li>Malignancy suspicion necessitates further evaluation and timely gynecologic intervention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Patient Counseling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Educate patients about different cyst types, their typical symptoms, and the importance of seeking medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Pain Management</h2>
    <p>Use NSAIDs as first-line pain relief; oral opioids should be reserved for severe cases.</p>

    <h2 class="strong">Avoid Routine Oral Contraceptives</h2>
    <p>Oral contraceptives are not recommended for routine management of ovarian cysts, as studies show no significant difference in resolution compared to expectant management.</p>

    <h2 class="strong">Multidisciplinary Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Collaborate with gynecologists for timely intervention and management of complex cysts or suspected malignancies.</p>

    <h2 class="strong">Patient Follow-Up</h2>
    <p>Ensure proper referral and follow-up arrangements for patients with unresolved or complex cysts.</p>

    <p>Amniotic fluid embolus is the release of amniotic fluid into maternal circulation, often during labor or uterine manipulation. This rare event can have severe consequences for the mother.</p>
    
    <h2 class="strong">Foundations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Amniotic fluid embolus can occur during labor, induced abortions, miscarriages, second/third trimesters, amniocentesis, or abruptio placentae.</li>
      <li>It is a rare but leading cause of cardiovascular collapse during labor, with high maternal mortality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Clinical Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Suspect amniotic fluid embolus during the second/third trimester, especially with uterine manipulation.</li>
      <li>Key clinical features include sudden hypotension, hypoxia, and coagulopathy due to an immunologic response.</li>
      <li>Triggers for this condition include histamine, endothelin, leukotrienes, which lead to DIC, respiratory distress, and ventricular dysfunction.</li>
      <li>Approximately 20% of cases present with an initial seizure, while 50% develop a bleeding diathesis and DIC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Differential Diagnoses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider other conditions like pulmonary embolus, drug-induced anaphylaxis, or septic shock.</li>
      <li>Eclampsia also presents with seizures, but it is associated with hypertension, not cardiovascular collapse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Diagnostic Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Diagnostic testing involves obtaining a complete blood cell count, coagulation studies, arterial blood gas, and chest radiograph.</li>
      <li>Urine output should be monitored after urinary catheter placement.</li>
      <li>Definitive diagnosis is often made at autopsy, where fetal hairs, squamous cells, and debris in maternal circulation can be detected.</li>
      <li>The clinical syndrome matches the typical diagnosis along with characteristic findings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Management is based on anecdotal evidence and animal studies due to the rarity of amniotic fluid embolus.</li>
      <li>Initial steps include administering high-flow oxygen and intubation for ventilation/oxygenation support.</li>
      <li>Aggressive fluid resuscitation and inotropic cardiovascular support are essential.</li>
      <li>Managing consumptive coagulopathy is a critical component of treatment.</li>
      <li>Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is often required in the intensive care unit.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Amniotic fluid embolus is a rare but life-threatening event during pregnancy, leading to rapid cardiovascular collapse. Recognizing the clinical features and promptly providing supportive measures is crucial for improving maternal outcomes.</p>

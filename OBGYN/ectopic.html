    <h2 class="strong">Risk Factors for Ectopic Pregnancy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tubal surgery, pelvic inflammatory disease, smoking, advanced age, prior spontaneous abortion, medically induced abortion, history of infertility, intrauterine device use, and assisted reproduction techniques are all known risk factors.</li>
      <li>These risk factors can help healthcare providers identify individuals who are at a higher risk for ectopic pregnancy and require closer monitoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Clinical Presentation and Symptoms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ectopic pregnancy can be challenging to diagnose due to its variable and sometimes nonspecific symptoms.</li>
      <li>Classic symptoms include delayed menses, abdominal pain, and vaginal bleeding, but not all patients present with the same combination of symptoms.</li>
      <li>Patients with known risk factors should be evaluated carefully, even if their symptoms are not typical.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Diagnostic Tools</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Transvaginal ultrasonography is a sensitive method for diagnosing ectopic pregnancies, especially in stable patients.</li>
      <li>Serial measurement of serum hCG levels can help track the progression of pregnancy and determine the likelihood of viable intrauterine pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Laparoscopy is an accurate diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, especially for unstable patients or those with unclear ultrasound results.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Management and Treatment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The management of ectopic pregnancy depends on the patient's stability and the characteristics of the pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Unstable patients require immediate intervention, including surgery or medical management.</li>
      <li>Stable patients with a confirmed ectopic pregnancy can be managed medically with methotrexate, a drug that stops the growth of the abnormal pregnancy tissue.</li>
      <li>Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure that the hCG levels return to normal and the ectopic pregnancy resolves.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Complications and Follow-Up</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Medical management with methotrexate has a success rate of around 85% to 93%, but close monitoring is necessary to detect any signs of treatment failure.</li>
      <li>Surgical intervention, whether through laparoscopy or laparotomy, may be needed in cases of severe ectopic pregnancy, rupture, or methotrexate failure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Preventive Measures</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Early prenatal care and regular check-ups can help detect ectopic pregnancies in their early stages.</li>
      <li>Educating individuals about the risks associated with certain contraceptives and reproductive procedures can help reduce the incidence of ectopic pregnancies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Patient Education</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patients should be educated about the symptoms of ectopic pregnancy, the importance of early medical attention, and the need for follow-up care after any form of treatment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Advancements in Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Advances in ultrasound technology and serum hCG level monitoring have improved the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosing ectopic pregnancies.</li>
      <li>Laparoscopic techniques have become more common, leading to less invasive surgical interventions.</li>
    </ul>

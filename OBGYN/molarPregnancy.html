    <h1 class="subheading">Molar Pregnancy</h1>
    <h2 class="strong">Types of Molar Pregnancy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Molar pregnancy is classified into two main types: Complete Hydatidiform Mole (CHM) and Partial Hydatidiform Mole (PHM).</li>
      <li>CHM occurs when an egg without maternal DNA is fertilized and the duplicated haploid genome results in abnormal trophoblastic proliferation.</li>
      <li>PHM arises from the fertilization of a normal egg by two sperm, leading to triploid karyotype and some fetal tissue along with trophoblastic hyperplasia.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="strong">Clinical Presentation and Symptoms</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Early molar pregnancies may not show significant clinical signs.</li>
      <li>Risk factors for molar pregnancy include extreme maternal age.</li>
      <li>Symptoms can include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and respiratory distress.</li>
      <li>The absence of fetal heart tones during the second trimester may raise suspicion of molar pregnancy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Diagnosis and Sonographic Appearance</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ultrasonography plays a crucial role in diagnosing molar pregnancy.</li>
      <li>The classic "snowstorm appearance" of hydropic vesicles in the uterus is highly suggestive of molar pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Partial molar pregnancies can also display cystic changes.</li>
      <li>Ovarian theca lutein cysts and ovarian torsion may be present due to hormonal stimulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Complications and Diagnostic Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Molar pregnancies can lead to complications like pre-eclampsia, respiratory distress from trophoblastic embolization, hyperemesis gravidarum, and uterine bleeding.</li>
      <li>Ultrasonography is valuable, but diagnosis might require histopathologic examination of abortion specimens, especially in partial molar pregnancies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Management and Follow-Up</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The primary management approach is uterine dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove molar tissue.</li>
      <li>After D&C, patients require close monitoring for potential trophoblastic sequelae.</li>
      <li>Patients are at risk of developing invasive moles or choriocarcinoma, which require specialized oncologic treatment involving chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Oncologic Implications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A subset of molar pregnancies can progress to gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), including invasive moles and choriocarcinoma.</li>
      <li>GTN necessitates vigilant follow-up, often involving specialized oncology care and close surveillance of hCG levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Patient Counseling and Education</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patients diagnosed with molar pregnancy should receive comprehensive counseling about the condition, potential complications, and the need for vigilant follow-up and monitoring.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Collaborative Care</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Molar pregnancies often require a multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, gynecologic oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists to ensure accurate diagnosis and optimal management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Research and Advances</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ongoing research aims to improve the early diagnosis, prognosis, and management of molar pregnancies, especially in the context of potential malignant progression.</li>
      <li>Understanding the intricacies of molar pregnancies is essential for healthcare professionals to provide appropriate care, counseling, and timely interventions to affected individuals.</li>

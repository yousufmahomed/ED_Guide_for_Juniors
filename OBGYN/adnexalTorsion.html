    <h2 class="strong">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Adnexal torsion is the twisting of the ovary and/or fallopian tube on their ligaments, leading to obstruction of blood supply and potential ischemia. It is a gynecologic emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and management.
    </p>

    <h2 class="strong">Risk Factors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Known risk factors for adnexal torsion include an ovarian mass, recent assisted reproductive treatments, pregnancy (especially in the first and early second trimesters), and a history of tubal ligation.</li>
      <li>Torsion is more common in the reproductive years due to the regular development of a corpus luteal cyst during the menstrual cycle.</li>
      <li>Premenarchal patients may experience torsion due to excessive adnexal mobility.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="strong">Diagnostic Evaluation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Clinical assessment is crucial in guiding management decisions.</li>
      <li>Ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging modality for suspected adnexal torsion.</li>
      <li>Ultrasound findings may include asymmetric ovarian enlargement, twisted vascular pedicle, abnormal blood flow on Doppler ultrasound, and presence of an ovarian mass.</li>
      <li>Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered in atypical presentations or to rule out alternative diagnoses.</li>
      <li>Laparoscopy is indicated in cases of high clinical suspicion despite negative imaging or when surgical intervention is required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prompt surgical intervention is essential once the diagnosis of adnexal torsion is suspected.</li>
      <li>Attempts at ovarian salvage are warranted even if the adnexal structures appear ischemic, as they often recover.</li>
      <li>Adnexal torsion left untreated can lead to complications such as hemorrhage, peritonitis, and infection.</li>
      <li>Diagnostic laparoscopy allows for both diagnosis and potential treatment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Follow-Up</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Close postoperative monitoring is necessary to assess recovery and potential complications.</li>
      <li>Patient education on preventive measures, risk factors, and early recognition of symptoms can help prevent delayed diagnosis and improve outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Multidisciplinary Collaboration</h2>
    <p>Collaborate with gynecologists, surgeons, radiologists, and other specialists as needed for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.</p>

    <h2 class="strong">Patient Counseling</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Educate patients about the signs and symptoms of adnexal torsion, especially those with known risk factors.</li>
      <li>Encourage timely reporting of symptoms to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Patient Empowerment</h2>
    <p>Empower patients with information about adnexal torsion and its risk factors to promote early detection and informed decision-making.</p>

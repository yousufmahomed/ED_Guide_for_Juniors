    <p>Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are serious conditions that can affect pregnant individuals. Understanding their foundations, pathophysiology, clinical features, and management is essential for ensuring the health of both the mother and the fetus.</p>
    
    <h2 class="strong">Foundations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Hypertension affects around 8% of pregnancies and is categorized into several types:</li>
      <li>Gestational Hypertension: Occurs during pregnancy, resolves postpartum, and is characterized by blood pressure â‰¥ 140/90 mm Hg.</li>
      <li>Pre-eclampsia: Gestational hypertension with proteinuria (>300 mg/24 hr).</li>
      <li>Eclampsia: Seizures in a patient with pre-eclampsia.</li>
      <li>Pregnancy-Aggravated Hypertension: Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia/eclampsia.</li>
      <li>Chronic or Coincidental Hypertension: Preexisting hypertension before pregnancy or persisting > 6 weeks postpartum.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Pathophysiology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-eclampsia is a unique vasospastic disorder in pregnant women.</li>
      <li>Vasospasm, ischemia, thrombosis in pre-eclampsia cause organ injury, placental infarction, abruption, fetal hypoxia, and prematurity.</li>
      <li>Eclampsia cause remains unknown; vascular responsiveness to endogenous vasopressors is implicated.</li>
      <li>Gestational hypertension has elevated cardiac output and abnormal peripheral resistance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Clinical Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Gestational Hypertension: Mild BP elevation, no proteinuria, normal reflexes, weight, organ function.</li>
      <li>Preeclampsia: Proteinuria, end-organ symptoms, visual disturbances, headache, hyperreflexia, oliguria, elevated creatinine, liver tenderness.</li>
      <li>Severe Preeclampsia: Diastolic BP > 110 mm Hg, severe proteinuria, signs of organ damage.</li>
      <li>Eclampsia: Seizures, visual disturbances, headache, hyperreflexia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, CNS effects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Complications</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HELLP Syndrome: Severe preeclampsia variant with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count.</li>
      <li>Other complications: Hepatic and splenic hemorrhage, abruptio placentae.</li>
      <li>Eclampsia: Seizures, coma, maternal CNS damage, renal insufficiency, maternal/fetal death.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Diagnostic Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Assess organ injury: complete blood count, renal/liver function, platelet count, coagulation profile, magnesium level.</li>
      <li>In severe cases, CT scan of head to exclude cerebral thrombosis or hemorrhage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong> Pre-eclampsia:</strong> Patients with mild preeclampsia are typically managed as outpatients or in a hospital setting, depending on the clinical situation. Treatment options include:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Bed Rest: Resting in a left lateral position to optimize uterine and placental perfusion.</li>
        <li>Close Monitoring: Frequent blood pressure measurements, urine tests for proteinuria, and assessment of signs and symptoms of worsening preeclampsia.</li>
        <li>Expectant Management: If the patient is less than 34 weeks pregnant and stable, expectant management with close follow-up may be considered, aiming to prolong the pregnancy while monitoring for disease progression.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <li><strong>Severe Pre-eclampsia</strong>: Management of severe preeclampsia typically requires hospitalization and may include:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Fetal Age Assessment: Evaluation of fetal gestational age and lung maturity to determine the optimal timing of delivery.</li>
        <li>Organ Function Testing: Comprehensive assessment of organ function, including blood tests to evaluate liver and kidney function.</li>
        <li>Blood Pressure (BP) Control: Antihypertensive medications are often necessary to lower elevated blood pressure and prevent complications. Medications like:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hydralazine:</strong> Administered intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM), with dosages typically starting at 5 mg IV every 20-30 minutes as needed to achieve BP control.</li>
          <li><strong>Labetalol:</strong> Administered orally or IV, with IV dosages starting at 20 mg, which can be repeated if necessary, up to a maximum dose of 80 mg.</li>
          <li><strong>Nifedipine:</strong> Oral nifedipine may be used in some cases, with an initial dose of 10-20 mg, followed by additional doses if needed.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    
      <li><strong>Fulminant Pre-eclampsia:</strong> The management of fulminant preeclampsia is similar to that of eclampsia and involves:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Control of Seizures: Using magnesium sulfate, as described below.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <li><strong>Eclampsia:</strong> Management of eclampsia is critical and includes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Control of Seizures: <strong>Magnesium sulfate</strong> is the primary medication used to prevent and treat seizures associated with eclampsia. The standard regimen is an initial loading dose of 4-6 grams IV over 15-20 minutes, followed by a maintenance dose of 2-3 grams per hour administered by continuous IV infusion. Serum magnesium levels should be monitored to avoid toxicity.</li>
        <li>Antihypertensives: Medications like hydralazine, labetalol, or nifedipine may also be administered to control elevated blood pressure.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <li><strong>Fluid Management:</strong> Care should be taken with fluid management:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid Diuretics: Diuretics should generally be avoided as they can lead to reduced circulating volume and worsen vasospasm.</li>
        <li>Hyperosmotic Agents: These should also be used with caution due to their potential to exacerbate vascular constriction.</li>
        <li>IV Fluids: Intravenous fluids may be administered to maintain adequate hydration and support uterine and fetal blood flow.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <li><strong>Goals:</strong> The primary goals of management are to prevent seizures, minimize organ damage, and achieve blood pressure control within safe limits for both the mother and the fetus.</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia can have severe consequences for both mother and fetus. Effective management involves close monitoring, BP control, prevention of seizures, and prompt delivery when necessary. Magnesium sulfate remains a critical intervention for preventing and treating eclamptic seizures, while antihypertensive therapy should be considered with caution to maintain uteroplacental blood flow. Comprehensive care and a multidisciplinary approach are essential for optimal outcomes in these conditions.</p>

    <h2 class="strong">Secondary Survey</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maternal Examination:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct a detailed examination of the mother.</li>
        <li>Examine the abdomen for uterine tenderness, contraction frequency, and vaginal bleeding.</li>
        <li>Perform an external perineal examination and a sterile speculum examination as needed.</li>
        <li>Monitor for potential vaginal injuries and initiate temporary treatments if needed.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Foetal Evaluation:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Monitor the foetal heart rate and detect foetal movement.</li>
        <li>Check for signs of foetal distress.</li>
        <li>Assess foetal heart rate variability.</li>
        <li>Identify and evaluate any decelerations in foetal heart rate.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Determining Stability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mother Stable, Foetus Stable:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Continuously monitor the viable foetus.</li>
        <li>Extend monitoring up to 24 hours if there are complications.</li>
        <li>On discharge, instruct the pregnant woman to monitor foetal movements.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Mother Stable, Foetus Unstable:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider caesarean section for the distressed foetus if necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Mother Unstable, Foetus Unstable:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Prioritize the Mother's Health:</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>In situations where both the mother and foetus are unstable, the primary focus should remain on stabilizing the mother first. Restoring maternal health will inherently benefit the foetus.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Decision for Resuscitative Hysterotomy:</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Resuscitative hysterotomy, previously known as a perimortem caesarean section, is a drastic but potentially lifesaving procedure for both the mother and the foetus.</li>
          <li>It becomes a consideration when the mother goes into cardiac arrest and does not achieve Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC) within 4-5 minutes.</li>
          <li>A key factor for this procedure is foetal viability. If the foetus is at a stage where it has the potential for independent life (typically beyond 20 weeks of gestation), then this procedure might be warranted.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Need for Senior, Experienced Intervention:</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Due to the complexities involved in a resuscitative hysterotomy and the associated risks, it is imperative that this procedure be performed by a senior surgeon with experience in emergency obstetric surgeries.</li>
          <li>The decision to carry out this procedure must be made swiftly, given the narrow window of time. However, it is crucial that the surgeon possesses the expertise and confidence to manage potential complications.</li>
          <li>Close collaboration with an experienced obstetrician is vital, as their expertise will be paramount in navigating challenges specific to the pregnant anatomy and ensuring the best outcome for both the mother and foetus.</li>
          <li>As postoperative care is also crucial, the presence of a senior anaesthesiologist, neonatologist, and critical care specialist can enhance maternal and foetal outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Post-Hysterotomy Management:</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>After the procedure, the mother should be monitored intensively. Any change in her condition should be addressed immediately with the involvement of relevant specialists.</li>
          <li>The neonatal team should be ready to provide immediate care to the newborn, especially if premature, to optimize the chances of survival and minimize complications.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Special Considerations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Defibrillation:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Perform defibrillation or cardioversion as required and monitor the foetus.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Resuscitative Hysterotomy:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Perform this procedure if maternal circulation is compromised, and the foetus is viable.</li>
        <li>Aim for rapid delivery to alleviate aortocaval compression.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><strong>Disposition:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Evaluate both the mother's and the foetusâ€™s stability.</li>
        <li>Continue monitoring for at least 4 hours even after minor trauma in pregnancies at or beyond 22-24 weeks.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h1 class="subheading">Abruptio Placentae</h1>
    
    <p>Abruptio placentae involves the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall and occurs in around 1% of pregnancies. This condition can have significant consequences for both the mother and the fetus.</p>
    
    <h2 class="strong">Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spontaneous hemorrhage into the decidua basalis leads to placental separation and compression.</li>
      <li>Clinical features include vaginal bleeding, dark blood, uterine tenderness, pain, uterine irritability, and contractions.</li>
      <li>Maternal hypertension, preeclampsia, advanced maternal age, parity, smoking, thrombophilia, prior miscarriage, and trauma are associated risk factors.</li>
      <li>Placental separation may be acute or gradual throughout late pregnancy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Severity and Diagnosis</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Placental separation severity varies, with symptoms ranging from occult bleeding to significant uterine contractions, fetal distress, and DIC.</li>
      <li>Detection is often clinical, based on signs of bleeding, uterine contractions, fetal distress, and coagulation parameters.</li>
      <li>Ultrasonography may not always be definitive due to similar echogenicity of fresh blood and placenta.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Fetal and Maternal Risks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fetal distress and death can result from interrupted placental blood and oxygen supply.</li>
      <li>Risk increases with the extent and speed of placental separation.</li>
      <li>Maternal risks include coagulopathy, exsanguination, fetomaternal transfusion, and amniotic fluid embolism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Differential Diagnoses</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Placenta previa is the main alternative diagnosis for late-pregnancy bleeding, characterized by painless, bright red bleeding, distinguishable with ultrasonography.</li>
      <li>Abdominal pain without vaginal bleeding should differentiate abruptio placentae from other causes like preeclampsia, pyelonephritis, liver diseases, gallbladder disease, appendicitis, and ovarian torsion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Clinical Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention are crucial for managing complications like abruptio placentae.</li>
      <li>Management approaches may include supportive care, monitoring for fetal distress, and consideration of urgent delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Multidisciplinary Care</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Treating complications in late pregnancy often requires collaboration among obstetricians, radiologists, anesthesiologists, and other specialists to ensure the best outcomes for both the mother and the fetus.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Understanding the nuances of complications in late pregnancy is essential for healthcare providers to make informed decisions and provide comprehensive care to pregnant individuals experiencing such issues.</p>

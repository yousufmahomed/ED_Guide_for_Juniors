    <p>Placenta previa, a condition where the placenta implants over the cervical os, is a significant cause of bleeding in the latter half of pregnancy. Understanding its pathophysiology, clinical features, and management is crucial for ensuring the well-being of both the mother and the fetus.</p>
    
    <h2 class="strong">Pathophysiology</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Placenta previa occurs when the placenta is located over the cervical os, increasing the risk of bleeding episodes during the second half of pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Risk factors include maternal age, smoking, multiparity, previous cesarean section, prior miscarriages or induced abortions, and preterm labor.</li>
      <li>Bleeding occurs due to the tearing of marginal placental vessels in the lower uterine segment during cervical dilation or uterine wall elongation.</li>
      <li>Early bleeding episodes are usually self-limited, but iatrogenic cervical probing or the onset of labor can exacerbate placental separation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Clinical Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Painless, fresh vaginal bleeding is the hallmark symptom of placenta previa.</li>
      <li>Around 20% of cases may involve some uterine irritability, but this is generally minor.</li>
      <li>Vaginal examination reveals bright red blood from the cervical os.</li>
      <li>All cases of painless, second-trimester vaginal bleeding should be initially treated as placenta previa until proven otherwise.</li>
      <li>Probing of the cervix should be avoided until placenta previa is excluded via ultrasound to prevent severe hemorrhage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Diagnostic Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ultrasonography is the gold standard for diagnosing placenta previa and determining placental location.</li>
      <li>Transvaginal ultrasonography is even more accurate for visualizing placental relationships and the internal os.</li>
      <li>Emptying the bladder before examination helps prevent overdiagnosis of placenta previa.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Immediate obstetric consultation is necessary when vaginal bleeding occurs in late pregnancy.</li>
      <li>Maternal stabilization involves establishing large-bore intravenous lines, fluid resuscitation, and continuous fetal monitoring.</li>
      <li>Baseline hemoglobin level, blood type, and coagulation studies are determined.</li>
      <li>Blood loss may require transfusion, and Rh-negative patients need Rh immune globulin.</li>
      <li>Stable patients are transferred to the obstetric unit, while unstable patients undergo expedited transfer or resuscitation before transfer.</li>
      <li>Fetal monitoring continues, and ultrasonography helps locate the placenta.</li>
      <li>In cases of suspected placenta previa, vaginal examination is performed in the delivery suite, where an emergency cesarean section can be carried out if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="strong">Further Management</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Patients with significant abruptio placentae may require early delivery, either vaginal or surgical, based on fetal status.</li>
      <li>If placenta previa is diagnosed or abruptio placentae is mild, the patient is closely monitored and ideally supported until fetal maturity is attained for a successful delivery.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The comprehensive management of placenta previa requires a multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, radiologists, and other specialists, as the condition can lead to severe bleeding and complications for both the mother and the fetus.</p>
